## Dark Forest Outpost Main Quests

LAST UPDATED 11 FEB 2020

### Main Quest 1/Ousting the Outpost

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Dark Forest Outpost
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Zanthei, 5 Ascre, and 5 Belasi
- **Rewards:** 1 Bone Key
- **Recommendations:** Make sure and pick up any dovetailing sidequests you can.

### Main Quest 2/Rats, Wrong Way!

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 1/Ousting the Outpost
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 3 Pickaxes, defeat 10 Takori, 11 Pakkan, and 12 Chu
- **Rewards:** 1 Bones Chest
- **Recommendations:** Remember that Pickaxes are in the Desert Expedition, if you didn't pick them up there the first time. And if you really hate travel, might be a good time to pick up 10 Kapir Tufts against the future.

### Main Quest 3/The Right Way?

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 2/Rats, Wrong Way!
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 15 Ardi Lamps
- **Rewards:** 1 Bone Key
- **Recommendations:** These are just the first 15 Ardi Lamps you'll need in the main questline; go ahead and pick up a full 25 while you're there, to save time. Remember that Ardi Lamps are in the Forest Expedition, in Forward Base. You might need to check out the Travel Directions section of the Guide to figure out how to unlock it if you haven't already. And while you're in the Forest, you might want to pick up the new sidequest that's just popped up in Luciola Forest. (And if you hate travel, DEFINITELY fight enough Kaija in Base Camp to get 20 Saliva Vials.)

### Main Quest 4/Attacking The Darkness

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 3/The Right Way?
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 6 Osalyu and 12 Belasi
- **Rewards:** 1 Bones Chest
- **Recommendations:** Now's a good time to work on the Belasi sidequests! That would be Nasty, Dust Air here, and the sidequest that just popped up in Luciola Forest that I recommended you pick up in the last one. Though be forewarned that the Luciola quest requires 10 Nets, which are pretty expensive, and Belasi are pretty cheap to just fight twice if you don't want 10 Nets staring you down indefinitely.

### Main Quest 5/ A Fox Untrusted

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 4/Attacking The Darkness
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Dust Wignow, deliver 10 Ardi Lamps
- **Rewards:** 1 Bone Key
- **Recommendations:** Ardi Lamps again! Otherwise, totally straightforward.

### Main Quest 6/ A Fox Untested

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 5/A Fox Untrusted
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat Dust Rudakai
- **Rewards:** 1 Bones Chest
- **Recommendations:** If you've done any Steel Boots quests, congrats! You know how to get Fabric Boots! If you've done 3PC's Tailor sidequest, you might have a spare pair on hand! (And if you haven't, now you know where to get one.) Otherwise, you might want to check out mbrennan's Resource Calculation Spreadsheet to keep track of the Leaf Boots and Leafsung Ink you'll need to make Leafsung Boots to make Fabric Boots: https://4thewords.com/forum/thread-return-of-the-resource-calculation-spreadsheet

### Main Quest 7/The True Reason

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 6/A Fox Untested
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Papple
- **Rewards:** 1 Bone Key
- **Recommendations:** Sweet and straightforward after the last few.

### Main Quest 8/Bound Up In

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 7/The True Reason
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 2 Sacred Feathers, 20 Essence, 20 Saliva Vials, 10 Kapir Tufts, 10 Refined Dust, 10 River Water
- **Rewards:** 1 Bones Chest
- **Recommendations:** And we're back to complex. But apart from the Refined Dust, all the resources are in the earlier game, so my All Resources section should be able to help you find them.

### Main Quest 9/Detect, Chain, Bind

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 8/Bound Up In
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat Miclan
- **Rewards:** 1 Bone Key
- **Recommendations:** So, Miclan requires 5 Steel Chains, 3 Pieces of Parchment, and 1 Blue Essence Ink to fight. If you've opened your Bone Chests so far, you should have enough for this. But at least none of these things are difficult to craft if need be. And you have three days to fight him!

### Main Quest 10/A Dogged Search

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 9/Detect, Chain, Bind
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Chaensi and 1 Lycosta
- **Rewards:** 1 Bones Chest
- **Recommendations:** Look! Lower requirements than Miclan! And again pretty straightforward.

### Main Quest 11/To Hound Babu

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 10/A Dogged Search
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Babu
- **Rewards:** 1 Bones Chest & 1 Bone Key
- **Recommendations:** Fewer requirements than Miclan, better quest rewards, and you get a good doggie!

### Main Quest 12/ Well of Lost Souls

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 11/To Hound Babu
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 25 Stone Blocks, 15 Reinforced Rope, 15 Sandstone Blocks, 15 Hardwood, and 10 Steel Bars
- **Rewards:** 1 Bones Chest & 1 Bone Key
- **Recommendations:**  Yes, it's a grind. Same as the end of several other regions. But it's a grind you know how to beat. And if you want to go pick up the new sidequest that lets you just battle Babu instead, it'll give you a shiny new Weapon1 with as much Attack as a Steel Mace (previous winner of Attack) and an additional 4 Luck.

## Dark Forest Outpost Initial

LAST UPDATED: 7 OCT 2019

There are quite a few quests I recommend picking up early on, so as to maximize monster battling, but there's nothing for this area that I recommend rushing to complete. And it all depends on how many slots you have open. Take it at your own pace! This is a section that largely rewards focus on the main quests.

## Pick Up Immediately

### A Shaman's Rope

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Dark Forest Outpost
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 25 Rat Tails
- **Rewards:** 1 Bone Key
- **Recommendations:** This really dovetails well with Pit of Nightmares, which I highly recommend as the source of all your Rat Tail needs. It also unlocks another quest with a Bone Chest as a reward, so it's a nice source of resources. Note that it won't be possible to complete this till after completing the first Main Quest and unlocking the first monsters that drop Rat Tails.

### Bone To Pick

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Dark Forest Outpost
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 40 Burhar
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Dark Forest Shoulder Pads https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;darkforest&#95;shoulders.png
- **Recommendations:** One major upside: Burhar drop Steel Chains, which are very useful later in the area, so this is a good way to double up grinding with a quest. 40 is overkill for that purpose, though. It's up to you.

### Familiar Family Friends

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Dark Forest Outpost
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat:
  - 5 Wignow
  - 5 Desert Wignow
  - 5 Dust Wignow
  - 5 Nezthai
  - 5 Zanthei
  - 5 Sacer
  - 5 Ascre
  - 5 Belasi
  - 5 Reenu
  - 1 Dust Rudakai
  - 1 Desert Rudakai
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Dark Forest Roots Bracers https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;roots&#95;braces.png
- **Recommendations:** Go ahead and pick it up and hold onto it if you have space. Obviously this is a long-term commitment! Also, Dust Rudakai don't show up until you complete Main Quest 5. But some of it will take care of itself as you go. (Notice that three of the five monster requirements are going to be knocked out by the first Main Quest. Go on, grab it!)

### Nasty, Dust Air

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Dark Forest Outpost
- **Type:** Battle and Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 20 Belasi; Collect 20 Reenu Wings, and 100 Dust 
- **Rewards:** 1 Bones Chest
- **Recommendations:** Belasi drop Reenu Wings, so you won't need to travel for that if you're low. You can pick this up immediately, but don't stress it till you get to the Main Quest that requires 12 Belasi anyway.

### Pit of Nightmares

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Dark Forest Outpost
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 250 Chu
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Dark Forest Bones Skirt  https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;darkforest&#95;skirt.png
- **Recommendations:** Pick up immediately if you have space, complete at leisure. Chu will turn up after you finish the first Main Quest. You'll be battling 12 Chu for the Main Quests, so it's up to you how long to wait. Also, Chu are your best source of Rat Tails, so if you want to do any of those quests, this kind of works as a doubling up. (I do adore that skirt. Totally worth 25K words.)

## As You Please

### Deliver With A Smile

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Dark Forest Outpost
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 15 each: Leafsung Ink, Spider Poison, Red Dye
- **Rewards:** 1 Dark Forest Amulet
- **Recommendations:** This is an Inventory item, an Accessory that gives you +10 Luck. Decide for yourself if it's worth it for you.

### Dessti's New Home

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Dark Forest Outpost
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Gather 50 Hardwood, 15 Steel, 25 Reinforced Rope, and 100 Raw Fabric
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Dark Forest Pin https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;darkforest&#95;pin.png
- **Recommendations:** How much do you like that pin? It's lovely. It may or may not be worth 25 Reinforced Rope and 15 Steel and 50 Hardwood to you (though Raw Fabric is so cheap, it's no big to spend it). Take it or leave it, as you please!

### Rebuild the Dock

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Dark Forest Outpost
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 150 Wood, 50 Hardwood, 150 Rope, 50 Reinforced Rope, 25 Steel Bars, and 25 Stone Blocks
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Dark Forest Skirt https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;dark&#95;forest&#95;skirt&#95;blue.png
- **Recommendations:** ... it depends how much you like that skirt. It really is pretty. It's also better as a long-term goal than a short-term one, I think. And since it's a pure Collection quest, you don't need to be holding onto it in your Questbook to be able to work on it.

## Dark Forest Outpost All Sidequests

LAST UPDATED 11 FEB 2020

### * A Cursed Couple

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 10/A Dogged Search
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 25 Lycosta and 25 Chaensi
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Dark Forest Roots Belt https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;roots&#95;belt.png
- **Recommendations:** Obviously a long-term commitment, and obviously a wardrobe reward. If you need to grind for the resources to fight these monsters, Zanthei are practically Piece of Parchment farms with enough Refined Dust to help make Blue Essence Ink, and the act of fighting these monsters gives you all the Steel you'll need for Steel Chains.

### A Shaman's Rope

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Dark Forest Outpost
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 25 Rat Tails
- **Rewards:** 1 Bone Key
- **Recommendations:** This really dovetails well with Pit of Nightmares, which I highly recommend as the source of all your Rat Tail needs. It also unlocks another quest with a Bone Chest as a reward, so it's a nice source of resources.

### * Pieces For Peace

- **Unlocked by:** A Shaman's Rope

- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Dark Forest Shoulder Pads https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;darkforest&#95;shoulders.png
- **Recommendations:** One major upside: Burhar drop Steel Chains, which are very useful later in the area, so this is a good way to double up grinding with a quest. 40 is overkill for that purpose, though. It's up to you.

### * Fetch! Play! Battle!

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 11/To Hound Babu
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Babu
- **Rewards:** 1 Dark Forest Sword
- **Recommendations:** Whoza good boy? Babu's gonna get you a Dark Forest Sword, which has as much Attack as any other Weapon1 and more Luck than the Steel Mace that ties it. I like this quest.

### Nasty, Dust Air

- **Type:** Battle and Collection

- **Recommendations:** ... it depends how much you like that skirt. It really is pretty. It's also better as a long-term goal than a short-term one, I think. And since it's a pure Collection quest, you don't need to be holding onto it in your Questbook to be able to work on it.

### * Reinforced Ardi Lamp Station (1/4)

- **Unlocked by:** DFO Main Quest 12/Well of Lost Souls
- **Type:** Collection, Battle, Streak
- **Requirements:** 
  - Collect:
    - 50 Wood
    - 15 Rope
    - 5 Steel Bars
    - 50 Ardia Dust
    - 50 Ardii Dust
    - 50 Ardis Dust
  - Maintain 15-day Streak
  - Defeat:
    - 1 Wetu
    - 1 Tylu
    - 1 Xuso
    - 1 Osaril
    - 1 Burhar
- **Rewards:** 1 Bones Chest, 1 Bone Key, 5 Reinforced Ardi Lamps
- **Recommendations:** If you want to do it, pick it up as soon as it's available, and see how you can dovetail it with the Step Into The Deadlands quest chain of battling the dead across Oge-Mai and Expedition. Be warned: if you want to complete this entire quest chain, you'll need more than 50 each of Ardi* Dust. More like 290 each...

### * Light Up The Outpost (2/4)

- **Unlocked by:** Reinforced Ardi Lamp Station (1/4)
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 10 Reinforced Ardi Lamps
- **Rewards:** 15 Pieces of Parchment
- **Recommendations:** Take a peek ahead and think about how many Reinforced Ardi Lamps you want to craft. 5 isn't *too* expensive, but the amount keeps increasing, and the rewards don't look worth the cost at the moment. Unless you really like the wardrobe version of the Ardi Lamp available at the end.

### * The Path South (3/4)

- **Unlocked by:** Light Up The Outpost (2/4)
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 25 Reinforced Ardi Lamps
- **Rewards:** 25 Dust Chains
- **Recommendations:** No, I haven't found a use for Dust Chains yet. The chief use of this quest is unlocking the next.

### * The Gate Path (4/4)

- **Unlocked by:** The Path South (3/4)
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 50 Reinforced Ardi Lamps
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Ardi Lamp https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;hands&#95;ardi&#95;lamp&#95;yellow.png
- **Recommendations:** Yes, this is the end of the quest chain.

### * Step Into The Deadlands (1/4)

- **Unlocked by:** DFO Main Quest 12/Well of Lost Souls
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Papple Spirits
- **Rewards:** 1 Staff of the Dead
- **Recommendations:** This series culminates in my favorite ever Wardrobe reward (see Flutters Shy & High), and Papple Spirits have the great virtue (great in my opinion, anyway) of Not Having Any Price Tag Other Than Words. The reward is a Weapon2 I can take or leave, but it's great for anyone trying to max Luck.

### * Hounding the Dead (2/4)

- **Unlocked by:** Step Into The Deadlands (1/4)
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Molox
- **Rewards:** 3 Bone Keys and 1 Bone Chest
- **Recommendations:** Molox are pretty simple, apart from the price tag (did you finish Bone To Pick? if not, you might consider taking it up, because those Burhar drop the Steel Chains you'll need)

### * Message in a Spirit (3/4)

- **Unlocked by:** Hounding the Dead (2/4)
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Spirit Lorsini
- **Rewards:** 1 Bones Chest & 1 Bone Key
- **Recommendations:** Gotta go to Mama Tree to find Spirit Lorsini! Here's some of that "seeing the dead" the last Main Quest was talking about. This is a good time to catch up on some of the stuff for the Reinforced Ardi Lamp Station.

### * Flutters Shy & High (4/4)

- **Unlocked by:** Message in a Spirit (3/4)
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Spirit Gordiliana
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Gordiliani Spirit Pet https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;gordi&#95;butterfly&#95;pet.png
- **Recommendations:** Gotta go to Ruins for Gordiliani, and as soon as you finish this quest Spirit Griffes appear alongside them. Maybe check out Balance after that. And enjoy your adorable, adorable Gordiliani Spirit Pet.

## Sidequests Unlocked By Dark Forest Outpost

## Luciola

### * A Dusted Experiment

- **Unlocked by:** DFO Main Quest 1/Ousting the Outpost
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 20 Belasi, collect 10 Nets, collect 10 Reinforced Rope
- **Rewards:** 3 Leafsung Ink
- **Recommendations:** If you're gonna do it, pick it up as soon as it appears and dovetail it with Nasty, Dust Air. But there are better ways to get Leafsung Ink these days (such as the Mama Tree Bite My Boots! quest...)

### * Dark Luciola Materials (1/5)

- **Unlocked by:** DFO Main Quest 12/Well of Lost Souls
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 15 Bones, 20 Rat Tail, 5 Blue Essence Ink
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest, 1 Wooden Key
- **Recommendations:** This quest chain is worth examining, but it's more of a long-term goal than a quick one. It's also distributed, with each quest picked up in a different area. Go ahead and look through the whole Dark [X] Materials quest chain to see what you like. Skull boots for your Wardrobe? Leafsung Keys? Dí Bags? Is it worth the Dark Forest Outpost stuff? Don't forget that Rat Tails are a side effect of working on the Pit of Nightmares quest!

## Mama Tree

### * Bite My Boots!

- **Unlocked by:** DFO Main Quest 12/Well of Lost Souls
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 10 Dark Forest Boots
- **Rewards:** 25 Leafsung Ink
- **Recommendations:** This is really easy if you can get your hands on a dozen or so Bones Chests & Keys, whether through quest rewards or whatever. If all else fails, Miclan drops both Bones Chests & Bone Keys. And all the lovely Leafsung Ink!

### * Dark Tree Materials (2/5)

- **Unlocked by:** Dark Luciola Materials (1/5)
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 20 Bones, 10 Blue Essence, 15 Refined Dust, 20 Pieces of Parchment, 50 Rat Tails
- **Rewards:** 5 Leafsung Keys
- **Recommendations:** Same as I said for Dark Luciola Materials. I'm always overstocked on Golden Chests and understocked on Leafsung Keys, so this is heaven for me.

## 3PC

### * Dark Three Materials (3/5)

- **Unlocked by:** Dark Tree Materials (2/5)
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 30 Steel Chains, 30 Rat Tails, 30 Refined Dust, 30 Pieces of Parchment, 30 Bones
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Dark Forest Boots https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;featured&#95;darkforest&#95;boots.png
- **Recommendations:** See the pretties? Go ahead and try to collect for the next quest, too, before you do too much traveling around.

## Gansu

### * Dark Watering Materials (4/5)

- **Unlocked by:** Dark Three Materials (3/5)
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 20 Vials Blue Essence Ink
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest, 1 Leafsung Key, 1 White Fur
- **Recommendations:** Obviously you'll have to come back to the Desert to spend this reward, but 3PC is lovely this time of year. You might need to gather Glass Bars before you head back to Gansu, and consider getting enough for 25 rather than just 20 Blue Essence Ink.

## Balance

### * Dark Floating Materials (5/5)

- **Unlocked by:** Dark Watering Materials (4/5)
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 20 Bones, 20 Steel Chains, 15 Refined Dust, and 5 vials Blue Essence Ink
- **Rewards:** 10 Dí Bags and 10 River Water
- **Recommendations:** At this point, I'm a little underwhelmed with the rewards (would have been overjoyed to get them during Riza), but hey. Dust Wignow will get you Refined Dust and Bones, Burhar will get you Steel Chains, and hopefully you can manage the rest.
