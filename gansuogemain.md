## Gansu Watering Hole Main Quests

### Main Quest 1: Circle of Protection

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Gansu Watering Hole
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Wetu and 2 Rulo, and collect 15 Desert Stones
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest
- **Recommendations:** It won't hurt to collect a whole lot more Desert Stones than that. Desert Wignow will be your best source if you don't already have enough on hand.

### Main Quest 2: Lorsa Nest Network

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 1/Circle of Protection
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect/Craft 1 Lorsa Nest
- **Rewards:** 100 Coins
- **Recommendations:** Good news! This is the last time you'll be required to build a Lorsa Nest in the game (though there are some sidequests that require it). Bad news: if you don't already have enough Claws to build this, you'll have to head back to the Forest to get them. Make sure you're stocked up on Reenu Wings while you're there; you'll be needing half a dozen later.

### Main Quest 3: Sacred Shrine

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 2/Lorsa Nest Network
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Get 10 Stone Blocks, 5 Sandstone Blocks, 5 Desert Stone, 1 White Fur, and 1 Sacred Feather
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest
- **Recommendations:** Now we're cooking! Suulan and Arenica are now available to fight. If you're low on Steel Daggers to fight them, consider going back to the Forest and fighting Assassins for them, though they're always available in the 3PC Item Bazaar also. You'll probably be spending some time there crafting Sandstone Blocks, too. This is a good time to get a lot of side quests done and dally a bit.

### Main Quest 4: The Welcoming Committee

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 3/Sacred Shrine
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Lombri, 2 Yasri, 2 Kiru, and 2 Bruja
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest
- **Recommendations:** With all these Stone Chests, I hope you've been doing the Weekly Global Quests for Stone Keys! You know the routine by now.

### Main Quest 5: White Stars' Light

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 4/The Welcoming Committee
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 3 White Fur
- **Rewards:** 100 Coins
- **Recommendations:** Obviously this will be Suulan battles, probably two of them. Do as you will.

### Main Quest 6: Waters of History

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 5/White Stars' Light
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Kiru and 3 Bruja
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest
- **Recommendations:** This is the last quest before the two-part finale (wow, who knew there could be so many Main Quests, right?) Good time to take stock and consider how many sidequests you'd like to cross off now.

### Main Quest 7: Red Witch of the Southern Coven

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 6/Waters of History
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat the Red Witch (4000 words in 1000 minutes)
- **Rewards:** 1 Stempo
- **Recommendations:** You'll need a Stempo for the next quest, so don't lose or sell this one if it's your only one. Also: when you get to the next quest, READ MY RECOMMENDATION BEFORE COMPLETING.

### Main Quest 8: Dust to Dust

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 7/Red Witch of the Southern Coven
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat the Dust Witch (1 Stempo and 1200 words in 400 minutes)
- **Rewards:** Open Riza Rivertown, Stone of Air
- **Recommendations:** DO NOT DELIVER THIS QUESTâ€¦ until you've fought the Dust Witch as many times as you can.
  Because the Dust Witch will only stick around as long as this quest is in play. And 1200 words in 400 minutes (three words per minute! c'mon!) will give you *three* Stempos in return for the one you paid, on top of a Golden Chest AND a Stone Chest. (Stone Chests get incredibly rare incredibly soon. Don't waste the opportunity.) Sure, you won't be able to open them until you get the Stone Keys one slow week at a time (although there are more Stone Key quests ahead), but it's worth the investment. Plus, those Protective Mantles you can sell for cash at the time being.
