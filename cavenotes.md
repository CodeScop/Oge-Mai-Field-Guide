LAST SAVED FOR UPLOAD Sun 25 Oct 8:56 PM Eastern Time

If you're here, then you probably know enough to know there's a Cave beyond the Purple Gate. I've transferred the questline to the summary in the Guide, but the rest of my notes still need some refining. I've finished all but the last tidbits of data gathering; once I finish confirming the range of monster drops, I'll probably start integrating the data.
