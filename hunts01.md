LAST UPDATED 27 FEB 2021

If you haven't yet, check out my Hunt Intro a couple chapters ago to get a grounding in the Hunt for the Ancients. The Hunt for the Ancients started in 2020 as an event that updated on a roughly monthly basis. It's grown into one of the more tangled and delightful paths of the game.

**There is no easy way to follow the Hunt to its endpoint; watch the trail!** There's a chain of 16 quests, which in turn require the support of 11 other quests, in order to unlock every Ancient. **I group these 27 quests as "The Main Line" in my Hunt sections.** If you can keep track of which of these you've picked up and which you haven't, you'll have a much easier time advancing in the Hunt. The many, many other quests are entirely optional as of yet.

This part of the Guide is for Season One, or the quests and chains involving the Ancient of Hope and focused in the Forest Region. Once you've finished the quest to battle this Ancient (part of the Main Line!), you'll unlock Season 2.

Allons-y!

##Quests

Hunt for the Ancients Quests! Well, to start with, there's just one:

### Joining the Hunt

- **Type:** Wordcount/Level
- **Requirements:** Min Level 3, 3000 Words
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens, unlock the Hunt
- **Recommendations:** This is not optional if you want to participate in the Hunt. Might as well get it done immediately! See what other quests you can do while you're generating 3000 words.

Once you finish that one, the Hunt opens up in earnest.

## Season 1 Quests - the Main Line

This is the sequence of quests you need to particularly focus on if you wish to advance to further Seasons of the Hunt. There are two halves: the quests that actually advance you, which require you to have Hunt Map Pieces, and the quests that *provide* the Hunt Map Pieces.

NOTE: The Hunt is unique in the Guide in that I do not list it by area, but rather by phase; HuntS1 is specifically the Hunt for the Ancients quests before you unlock the Desert phase of the Hunt. **Please note the Unlocked By bits - several quests aren't available until you complete others.**

### A Clue to the Past

- **Unlocked by:** Joining the Hunt
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Sassi
- **Rewards:** 5 Hunter Tokens & 1 Hunt Map Piece
- **Recommendations:** This is an absolute prerequisite for the Hunt Begins quest. That's almost beside the point for me, because I will be tracking down those Sassis like there's no tomorrow to raid the Token Store of all its goods, and this is a nice side benefit, but yeah: worth prioritizing a bit.

### Elder Library Assistants

- **Unlocked by:** A Clue To The Past
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Alnu
- **Rewards:** Hunt Map Piece 2, 5 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Pick up as soon as you have Forest Expedition open and can get to Alnu wandering around there. Nothing to lose! 

### Elder Library's Security

- **Unlocked by:** Elder Library Assistants
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Clawadin
- **Rewards:** 5 Hunter Tokens, 1 Hunt Map Piece 3
- **Recommendations:** May the Force be with you against these fierce guardians.

### The Hunt Begins

- **Unlocked by:** Joining the Hunt
- **Type:** Collection, Streak, Words, Level
- **Requirements:**
  - Collect: 1 Hunt Map Piece
  - Streak: 5-day Streak
  - Words: 5000 words
  - Level: Minimum Level 3
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Scarred Eye https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;featured&#95;hunt&#95;scar&#95;eye&#95;left&#95;blue.png
- **Recommendations:** It will take a little while to finish this, and you'll need to complete A Clue To The Past before it's possible to complete this (as it stands when this is being written), but it's worth picking up early so the harder parts have time to accumulate. Note that the Time of Reflection quest also requires a streak, so it doubles well with this.

### Deeper Forest Hunting

- **Unlocked by:** The Hunt Begins quest
- **Type:** Words, Streak, Level, Collection
- **Requirements:** Write 10K words, add 7 consecutive streak days, minimum level 3, Hunt Map Piece 2
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Full Body Scars https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;featured&#95;full&#95;body&#95;scars.png
- **Recommendations:** Pick this up and let it simmer in the background. Words and streak will more or less take care of themselves. Besides, there's no knowing what might be unlocked next month in this quest sequence! You can get Hunt Map Piece 2 by completing Elder Library Assistants.

### A Past Not Forgotten

- **Unlocked by:** Deeper Forest Hunting
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Possess one Hunt Map Piece 3
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Pauldrons https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;armor&#95;pauldrons.png
- **Recommendations:** I'll tell you a secret: this is not a quest. Not really. The requirements are basically "complete the Elder Library's Security quest and don't sell what you get from it". So go do that, and get some cool wardrobe items as a bonus when you're done.

### The Curator of Elder Library

- **Unlocked by:** A Past Not Forgotten
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4x the Curator of Elder Library
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Sassi Pet https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;featured&#95;sassi&#95;pet.png
- **Recommendations:** HOW. HOW CAN YOU NOT. KITTY! (... and, y'know, unlocking subsequent Seasons of the Hunt. But. KITTY!)

## A Side Path: Proving Your XXX Questline

The quest Proving Your Worth 1/4 is actually 1/6 as of this writing (although also as of this writing, the title hasn't been updated yet to reflect that fact). Here's where that one goes, starting with the first one that opens at the start

### Proving Your Worth 1/4

- **Unlocked by:** Joining the Hunt
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat:
  - 3 Reenu
  - 2 Wignow
  - 1 Pester
  - 1 Mawt
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** This is mostly good for bragging rights, although it's pretty satisfying to have done. It dovetails well with the Luciola Forest quest Forest Creatures, and you'll get useful inventory battling these monsters.

### Proving Your Curiosity 2/4

- **Unlocked by:** Proving Your Worth 1/4
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 6 Nitana
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** This combines well with the Mama Tree Sidequest Fair, Standard, Middling (or, if you just like Nitana, don't worry about this and keep going).

### Proving Your Perseverance 3/4

THIS INCLUDES INFO AND SPOILERS FOR THE FOREST EXPEDITION

- **Unlocked by:** Proving Your Curiosity 2/4
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat:
  - 1 Buholi
  - 1 Sacer
  - 3 Kaija
  - 1 Gobkey
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** This might be subtitled "Explore Expedition!" because that's what it is. You'll need to complete Mama Tree before you can pick up the **New Adventurous Horizons** quest to unlock the Forest Expedition, and then you'll need to battle Sacer and Kaija in Base Camp, and then complete Hard Day's Walk to open Forward Base, then fight Nezthai in Forward Base to get the prerequisite 3 Nezthai Claws for Buholi, complete the Feeding the Lighthouse quest in Forward Base to unlock the quests to unlock the other three Forest Expedition areas, beat Javelin Toss West and North: Homeward Bound quests, then fight Buholi in Tall Trees and Gobkey in Guardian's Lair.
  Whew!
  That said, it's worth unlocking Expedition (and the followup quest to this requires unlocking Stone City, so don't skip that quest forever). If you were wondering where Buhini are, that's where. And there are other Mama Tree sidequests that benefit from Expedition being opened.

### Proving Your Cunning 4/4

THIS INCLUDES INFO AND SPOILERS FOR THE FOREST EXPEDITION

- **Unlocked by:** Proving Your Perseverance 3/4
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Sapira, 2 Sapilo, and 3 Sapiti
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Don't forget to battle at least one Kaija in Base Camp for each Sapi-beast you intend to battle (Kaija drop the Saliva Vials required to protect from the Sapi-monsters' poison). Then head over to Stone City in Expedition (got to complete our tour) to beat these beasties. Make sure you keep your Luck up, and you could get a Spider Poison per battle here. Nice rewards.

### Proving Your Mettle 5/6

- **Unlocked by:** Proving Your Cunning 4/4
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each Lorsa, Illi, Kuay, Tambo
- **Rewards:** 15 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** We've done our Luciola battles and our Forest Expedition battles; now it's time to prove ourselves in Mama Tree. Illi and Tambo are rather popular for sidequests, so maybe see if there are any that interest you before going into this.

### Proving Your Strength 6/6

- **Unlocked by:** Proving Your Mettle 5/6
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 6 Tylu
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Small Axe https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;678-small-axe-4213-56837.png
- **Recommendations:** There are bunches of sidequests that require fighting Tylu, so go comb the Mama Tree sidequests to be sure there aren't any you want to double up with (especially A Family Tree, with its almost-equal requirements)

## Another Side Path - Velts

I'm a little torn about putting all this in Season 1, because the rest of Season 1 fits comfortably in the Forest Region (Luciola Forest, Mama Tree, and the Forest Expedition areas). Once you finish the first Velts quest, you're launched all halfway around the game to complete the chain. Still, these ARE all available without unlocking Season 2, so I'm going to put them here.

### A Battle of Wills

- **Unlocked by:** The Hunt Begins
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Velts
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Velts is meant to be on the challenging side, and this launches her series of challenges roaming all around Oge-Mai. I highly recommend this series, because it's basically fighting Velts once in a bunch of places and getting a lot of bragging rights and some nice swag at the end. (Also, I'm particularly fond of the last Velts for niche Oh This Is So Great For This One Insanely Specific Thing reasons.) Note that you'll fight different Velts over different parts of the game, so you'll need to progress both in this quest and the main game to complete the chain.

### Battle of Merit

- **Unlocked by:** A Battle of Wills
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Velts: Desert
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Make sure you're fighting the 3PC version of Velts if you want to tackle this. She's tougher than the Mama Tree version, but doable enough.

### Battle of Constitution (3/4)

- **Unlocked by:** Battle of Merit
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Velts: Water
- **Rewards:** 15 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** This is the first time the Battle chain has explicitly acknowledged being a chain. And yes, the chain will continue!

### A Battle of Evolution (4/4)

- **Unlocked by:** Battle of Constitution 3/4
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Velts: Dust
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Battle Helmet https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;634-hunt-battle-helment-3693-42038.png (7 variants)
- **Recommendations:** Shockingly, Dust Velts is to be found in the Water Region, possibly enjoying Dí at Luko's Inn. As far as I can tell, this is the end of the quest chain, but this Velts has particularly nice drops (especially if you've recently opened Raina, or really any area beyond Riza).

## Season 1 Quests - Miscellaneous

Complete these as you please, in any order! These are one-shots that are entirely self-contained.

### Curator's Family

- **Unlocked by:** A Past Not Forgotten
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each: Burocat, Sassi, Clawadin, Alnu
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Look, if you don't just want to battle fierce kitties till the cows come home, I don't understand you. But if that marvelous option doesn't appeal to you, then there's not much need to focus on this quest. Unlike the other assistant quests, this does not advance the game.

### Protecting the Past

- **Unlocked by:** Joining the Hunt
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 10 Rusty Amulets and 10 Rusty Pendants
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** This is a bit on the expensive side - odds are it'll take far fewer battles to get the reward by fighting Sassi than by any other means. Still, if you happen to have a bunch lying around, it's worth considering.

### A Season for Hope

- **Unlocked by:** Joining the Hunt
- **Type:** Words
- **Requirements:** Write 2020 words
- **Rewards:** 5 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Pick it up and have it fill itself in the background. Easy-peasy.

### Spreading Hope

- **Unlocked by:** Joining the Hunt
- **Type:** Forum
- **Requirements:** Post 3 Messages in the Forum
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** I mean, I like the Forums quite a lot; I don't see the downside. Post away! If you're still starting out and wanting to avoid the Forums as much as possible, I'd combine this with the One Of Us sidequest in Luciola Forest and Tribe Member sidequest in Mama Tree.

### Studying Substance Samples

- **Unlocked by:** Joining the Hunt
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 50 Dust
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** I don't know about you, but I'm always overloaded on Dust. This is an easy YES.

### Time of Reflection

- **Unlocked by:** Joining the Hunt
- **Type:** Streak
- **Requirements:** Maintain a 4-day Streak
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** You'll be doing other quests requiring streaks as long or longer; might as well do this at the same time. (Hint: The Hunt Begins is one of those quests.)

### To Hope is to Plan

- **Unlocked by:** Joining the Hunt
- **Type:** Wordcount
- **Requirements:** Write 10K words
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Go ahead and pick this up right away; wordcount quests are ALWAYS good to have going on in the background

## Season 1 Part 2 Quests

The Hunt released four Seasons in 2020. 2021 launched with a series of quests that appear to be, effectively, Season 1 Part 2 - that is, they are unlocked with the culmination of the old Season 1, but they fit the theme of Season 1 and not Season 2. We'll see how this works as the year progresses!

###Base Camp Clearing Duty

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** HuntS1 Quest: The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Xuso, 10 Sacer, and 5 Kaija
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  This'll help you get the Saliva Vials for the Curator quest part 2, and dovetails well with Into Forest Depths.

###Curator's Catalog Collections 1/2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** HuntS1 Quest: The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 3 Essence, 1 Spider Poison, 3 Lorsa Fur, 1 Tambo Mane, and 5 Claws
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  This is mostly "put excess materials to good use", in my book; a lot of these materials will have been gathered with the quests to break into the Elder Library, so hurrah to that having a use for even experienced Hunt followers! (Also: chain, so weigh the benefits of the sequels.)

###Curator's Catalog Cache 2/2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** HuntS1.2 Quest: Curator's Catalog Collections (1/2)
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 5 each Nezthai Claws, Saliva Vials, Gobkey Trinkets, and Rusty Pendants
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  Huh, hadn't figured that there would be a series with these collection quests. (Note that when Part 1 came out, it wasn't labeled as such.) The Gobkey Trinkets are easy to get, and the Rusty Pendants will gradually accrue as you open chests in Mama Tree (with decent Luck); Saliva Vials are easy to farm but increasingly widely used, and Nezthai Claws are something you'll already need quite a few of to complete all the quests this round. But if that's not off-putting, go for it!

###Dynamic Disappearing Duo

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** HuntS1 Quest: The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 2 Rudakai and 2 Wignow
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  At the moment, I'd say the quest needs to be evaluated on aesthetic grounds, because on mercenary grounds it's useless, but it's kinda fun to beat up on the monsters that steal boots in the lore (Wignow) as well as the monsters that actually cost boots to fight (Rudakai).

###Familiar Assistants Needed!

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** HuntS1 Quest: The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 each Sassi, Alnu, Burocat, and Clawadin
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Aging Beard https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1526-hunt-aging-beard-10389-52135.png
- **Recommendations:**  This one REALLY feels like an optional sidequest!

###Great Library Cleanup!

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** HuntS1 Quest: The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Illi and 6 Kuay
- **Rewards:** 15 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  These are great sources of Rope and Wood, so you'll get something out of this quest other than the prize (Illi has a few quests you'll overlap with, also), but maybe wait till one or both are dropping Hunter Tokens to make this truly profitable.

###Into Forest Depths 1/3

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** HuntS1 Quest: The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Collection, Battle
- **Requirements:** Deliver 2 Saliva Vials and 2 Dandeleon Flowers, and defeat 3 Kaija, 3 Xuso, 5 Ardia, 5 Ardii, and 5 Ardis
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  You won't need to focus on Saliva Vials, since they'll pop up anyway while you're battling Kaija; if you've lost track, these monsters can be found entirely within Base Camp and Forward Base (or you can skip FB and battle Ardi-beasts in Mama Tree, if you've done the FB quest unlocking them!) Note that this dovetails well with the quest Base Camp Clearing Duty, if you haven't finished it yet.

###Into Forest Depths 2/3

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Into Forest Depths 1/3
- **Type:** Collection, Battle
- **Requirements:** Deliver 5 Dinti and 1 Spider Poison; defeat 5 Reudod, 3 Oncaiii, and 1 Finoir
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Facemask https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1534-hunt-neck-guard-10523-15955.png
- **Recommendations:**  Here, we move from BC and FB to Stone City and Tall Trees. The Spider Poison will pop up when you fight Oncaiii anyway; you will get some Dinti from Finoir, but might want to fight its tiny Scofin cousins to rack up more. (Or you might have plenty from the Alien Expedition.)

###Into Forest Depths 3/3

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Into Forest Depths 2/3
- **Type:** Collection, Battle
- **Requirements:** Deliver 2 Gobkey Trinkets, 2 Dandeleon Flowers, and 2 Essence; defeat 5 Gobkey, 5 Dandeleon, and 5 Maikile
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens and House Item: Hunt Shield Ornament https://4thewords.com/public/hideouts/hideout&#95;element&#95;322&#95;30102/variant&#95;icon&#95;1197&#95;737.png 
- **Recommendations:**  Hey, first House Item reward!!! (It can also be crafted in the Hunter Token Store if you want a more detailed look at it.) You'll definitely get all your resources during your battles, which are largely in Guardian's Lair. (I wonder if the Forward-Base-dwelling Dandeleon was originally a Guardian's-Lair-dwelling Night Dandeleon? If so, the switch was kind to users; Night Dandeleons disappear during the day, but their cousins are available 24/7.)

###A Secret Plan?

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** HuntS1 Quest: The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Assassins & 1 Villager
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Eyepatch https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1532-hunt-cloth-eyepatch-10480-77717.png
- **Recommendations:**  Here, I'm torn between "this feels like a throwaway quest" and "but the lore hints sound important!" I'll just settle for "hey, look, Assassins drop lots of nifty things and make sure you fight the Villager in Mama Tree, where it won't cost you!"

###Sticky, Sweet, and Alluring

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** HuntS1 Quest: The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 15 Reenu and 5 Nitana
- **Rewards:** 15 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  For the love of the flight (convenient that this quest is released when flying monsters are dropping Hunter Tokens!) Go for it!

###Tallest of Trees

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** HuntS1 Quest: The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Buhini, 5 Buhovi and 3 Buholi
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens and Wardrobe: Hunt Earrings Sword Shield https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1588-hunt-earings-sword-shield-11798-73484.png 
- **Recommendations:**  Bear in mind that you'll need 29 Nezthai Claws to complete this, which will probably mean 20-25 Nezthai battles as well, few of which will involve other quests. On the other hand, you get those really nifty earrings (you can switch which ear gets which earring, too, although it always has to be both and they always have to be different). Make sure there aren't any Buh-beast quests you want to do at the same time!

###Velts' Relaxation Method

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** HuntS1 Quest: The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Maikile, 1 Buholi, 1 Oncaiii, and 1 Nezthai
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  I suspect this is not all that important, but it's a nice way to make things count double!

###Velts' Strong Start

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** HuntS1 Quest: The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Streak, Wordcount, Battle
- **Requirements:** Reach 10-day Streak, write 10000 words, defeat 1 Tambo
- **Rewards:** 2 Stempos and Wardrobe: Hunt Aging Eyebrows https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1529-hunt-aging-eyebrows-10437-30092.png
- **Recommendations:**  My *guess* (emphasis on "guess") is that this will be the start of another Velts chain for this season, so I'm happy to get it out of the way. Curious if my guess holds up!

## Hunt-Specific Season 1 Monsters

Note that you must complete the **Joining the Hunt** quest for these to appear, and that Velts and the Curator will require more; after that, they may appear in a number of places, and are especially unpredictable in the Forest Expedition area. One monster needs a little more persuasion...
