LAST UPDATED 8 OCT 2020

If you haven't yet, check out my Hunt Intro a couple chapters ago to get a grounding in the Hunt for the Ancients. The "seasons" are important only in that they're released a month at a time, grouped by seasons; once released, the quests can be worked through at any pace you prefer.

Allons-y!

##Season 1 Quests

Hunt for the Ancients Quests! Well, to start with, there's just one:

### Joining the Hunt

- **Type:** Wordcount/Level
- **Requirements:** Min Level 3, 3000 Words
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens, unlock the Hunt
- **Recommendations:** This is not optional if you want to participate in the Hunt. Might as well get it done immediately! See what other quests you can do while you're generating 3000 words.

## Phase One: Unlocking the Hunt

These are the sidequests which appear immediately after you finish the Joining the Hunt sidequest.

NOTE: LF is an abbreviation for Luciola Forest; HuntS1 is specifically the Hunt for the Ancients section. **Please note the Unlocked By bits - some quests aren't available until you complete others.**

### A Clue to the Past

- **Unlocked by:** Joining the Hunt
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Sassi
- **Rewards:** 5 Hunter Tokens & 1 Hunt Map Piece
- **Recommendations:** This is an absolute prerequisite for the Hunt Begins quest. That's almost beside the point for me, because I will be tracking down those Sassis like there's no tomorrow to raid the Token Store of all its goods, and this is a nice side benefit, but yeah: worth prioritizing a bit.

### The Hunt Begins

- **Unlocked by:** Joining the Hunt
- **Type:** Collection, Streak, Words, Level
- **Requirements:**
  - Collect: 1 Hunt Map Piece
  - Streak: 5-day Streak
  - Words: 5000 words
  - Level: Minimum Level 3
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Scarred Eye https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;featured&#95;hunt&#95;scar&#95;eye&#95;left&#95;blue.png
- **Recommendations:** It will take a little while to finish this, and you'll need to complete A Clue To The Past before it's possible to complete this (as it stands when this is being written), but it's worth picking up early so the harder parts have time to accumulate. Note that the Time of Reflection quest also requires a streak, so it doubles well with this.

### Proving Your Worth 1/4

- **Unlocked by:** Joining the Hunt
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat:
  - 3 Reenu
  - 2 Wignow
  - 1 Pester
  - 1 Mawt
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** This is mostly good for bragging rights, although it's pretty satisfying to have done. It dovetails well with the Luciola Forest quest Forest Creatures, and you'll get useful inventory battling these monsters.

### Protecting the Past

- **Unlocked by:** Joining the Hunt
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 10 Rusty Amulets and 10 Rusty Pendants
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** This is a bit on the expensive side - odds are it'll take far fewer battles to get the reward by fighting Sassi than by any other means. Still, if you happen to have a bunch lying around, it's worth considering.

### A Season for Hope

- **Unlocked by:** Joining the Hunt
- **Type:** Words
- **Requirements:** Write 2020 words
- **Rewards:** 5 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Pick it up and have it fill itself in the background. Easy-peasy.

### Spreading Hope

- **Unlocked by:** Joining the Hunt
- **Type:** Forum
- **Requirements:** Post 3 Messages in the Forum
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** I mean, I like the Forums quite a lot; I don't see the downside. Post away! If you're still starting out and wanting to avoid the Forums as much as possible, I'd combine this with the One Of Us sidequest in Luciola Forest and Tribe Member sidequest in Mama Tree.

### Studying Substance Samples

- **Unlocked by:** Joining the Hunt
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 50 Dust
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** I don't know about you, but I'm always overloaded on Dust. This is an easy YES.

### Time of Reflection

- **Unlocked by:** Joining the Hunt
- **Type:** Streak
- **Requirements:** Maintain a 4-day Streak
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** You'll be doing other quests requiring streaks as long or longer; might as well do this at the same time. (Hint: The Hunt Begins is one of those quests.)

### To Hope is to Plan

- **Unlocked by:** Joining the Hunt
- **Type:** Wordcount
- **Requirements:** Write 10K words
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Go ahead and pick this up right away; wordcount quests are ALWAYS good to have going on in the background

## A Side Path: Proving Your XXX Questline

The quest Proving Your Worth 1/4 is actually 1/6 as of this writing (although also as of this writing, the title hasn't been updated yet to reflect that fact). Here's where that one goes after the first one (listed above)

### Proving Your Curiosity 2/4

- **Unlocked by:** Proving Your Worth 1/4
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 6 Nitana
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** On the off chance that you reach this before you've completed the third Main Quest in Luciola Forest: this combines well with that. Start this after you finish the Kyiat's Bridge quest. If you're further along, this combines well with the Mama Tree Sidequest Fair, Standard, Middling (or, if you just like Nitana, don't worry about this and keep going).

### Proving Your Perseverance 3/4

THIS INCLUDES INFO AND SPOILERS FOR THE FOREST EXPEDITION

- **Unlocked by:** Proving Your Curiosity 2/4
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat:
  - 1 Buholi
  - 1 Sacer
  - 3 Kaija
  - 1 Gobkey
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** This might be subtitled "Explore Expedition!" because that's what it is. You'll need to complete Mama Tree before you can pick up the **New Adventurous Horizons** quest to unlock the Forest Expedition, and then you'll need to battle Sacer and Kaija in Base Camp, and then complete Hard Day's Walk to open Forward Base, then fight Nezthai in Forward Base to get the prerequisite 3 Nezthai Claws for Buholi, complete the Feeding the Lighthouse quest in Forward Base to unlock the quests to unlock the other three Forest Expedition areas, beat Javelin Toss West and North: Homeward Bound quests, then fight Buholi in Tall Trees and Gobkey in Guardian's Lair.
  Whew!
  That said, it's worth unlocking Expedition (and the followup quest to this requires unlocking Stone City, so don't skip that quest forever). If you were wondering where Buhini are, that's where. And there are other Mama Tree sidequests that benefit from Expedition being opened.

### Proving Your Cunning 4/4

THIS INCLUDES INFO AND SPOILERS FOR THE FOREST EXPEDITION

- **Unlocked by:** Proving Your Perseverance 3/4
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Sapira, 2 Sapilo, and 3 Sapiti
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Don't forget to battle at least one Kaija in Base Camp for each Sapi-beast you intend to battle (Kaija drop the Saliva Vials required to protect from the Sapi-monsters' poison). Then head over to Stone City in Expedition (got to complete our tour) to beat these beasties. Make sure you keep your Luck up, and you could get a Spider Poison per battle here. Nice rewards.

### Proving Your Mettle 5/6

- **Unlocked by:** Proving Your Cunning 4/4
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each Lorsa, Illi, Kuay, Tambo
- **Rewards:** 15 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** We've done our Luciola battles and our Forest Expedition battles; now it's time to prove ourselves in Mama Tree. Illi and Tambo are rather popular for sidequests, so maybe see if there are any that interest you before going into this.

### Proving Your Strength 6/6

- **Unlocked by:** Proving Your Mettle 5/6
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 6 Tylu
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Small Axe https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;678-small-axe-4213-56837.png
- **Recommendations:** There are bunches of sidequests that require fighting Tylu, so go comb the Mama Tree sidequests to be sure there aren't any you want to double up with (especially A Family Tree, with its almost-equal requirements)

## Deeper Into The Hunt

There is a running trend through this Season of Hope: we battle the new library assistant monster for one quest, and the Hunt Map Piece we get from that contributes to a deeper Hunt storyline. **The library assistant monster quests** start with A Clue To The Past and **can** be completed independently; **the deeper Hunt progress quests**, starting with The Hunt Begins, **depend on the library assistant monster quests** to reach completion. (And thrown in there is a Velts stealth quest chain.)

### A Battle of Wills

- **Unlocked by:** The Hunt Begins
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Velts
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Velts is meant to be on the challenging side, and this launches her series of challenges roaming all around Oge-Mai. I highly recommend this series, because it's basically fighting Velts once in a bunch of places and getting a lot of bragging rights and some nice swag at the end.

### Elder Library Assistants

- **Unlocked by:** A Clue To The Past
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Alnu
- **Rewards:** Hunt Map Piece 2, 5 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Pick up as soon as you have Forest Expedition open and can get to Alnu wandering around there. Nothing to lose!

### Elder Library's Security

- **Unlocked by:** Elder Library Assistants
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Clawadin
- **Rewards:** 5 Hunter Tokens, 1 Hunt Map Piece 3
- **Recommendations:** May the Force be with you against these fierce guardians.

### Curator's Family

- **Unlocked by:** A Past Not Forgotten
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each: Burocat, Sassi, Clawadin, Alnu
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Look, if you don't just want to battle fierce kitties till the cows come home, I don't understand you. But if that marvelous option doesn't appeal to you, then there's not much need to focus on this quest. Unlike the other assistant quests, this does not advance the game.

### Deeper Forest Hunting

- **Unlocked by:** The Hunt Begins quest
- **Type:** Words, Streak, Level, Collection
- **Requirements:** Write 10K words, add 7 consecutive streak days, minimum level 3, Hunt Map Piece 2
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Full Body Scars https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;featured&#95;full&#95;body&#95;scars.png
- **Recommendations:** Pick this up and let it simmer in the background. Words and streak will more or less take care of themselves. Besides, there's no knowing what might be unlocked next month in this quest sequence! You can get Hunt Map Piece 2 by completing Elder Library Assistants.

### A Past Not Forgotten

- **Unlocked by:** Deeper Forest Hunting
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Possess one Hunt Map Piece 3
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Pauldrons https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;armor&#95;pauldrons.png
- **Recommendations:** I'll tell you a secret: this is not a quest. Not really. The requirements are basically "complete the Elder Library's Security quest and don't sell what you get from it". So go do that, and get some cool wardrobe items as a bonus when you're done.

### The Curator of Elder Library

- **Unlocked by:** A Past Not Forgotten
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4x the Curator of Elder Library
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Sassi Pet https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;featured&#95;sassi&#95;pet.png
- **Recommendations:** HOW. HOW CAN YOU NOT. KITTY! (... and, y'know, unlocking subsequent Seasons of the Hunt. But. KITTY!)

## Hunt-Specific Season 1 Monsters

  Late August 2020 sources are - wait for it - BLUE.
