LAST UPDATED 6 MAY 2020

We left off Season 1 (and you **must** complete The Curator of Elder Library to unlock Season 2, and the Season 1 quest list will help with that) back in the Forest. Now, in the Desert, we're on to Season 2: The Season of Wandering, watched over by the Shepherd.

For now, I'm going to keep this pretty simple, because there's only a few new things released...

## Season 2 Quests - The Main Line

Unlocking various stages of the Hunt is still progressing with pairs of quests at every stage: get a Hunt Map Piece from an Assistant, and then use the Hunt Map Piece for progressing in the Hunt in another quest.

### Guarding the Path

- **Unlocked by:** The Curator of Elder Library Quest
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Czanus
- **Rewards:** Hunt Map Piece 4
- **Recommendations:** This is (per history) going to end up being basically required to progress in the Hunt. Go ahead for it!

### All Who Wander

- **Unlocked by:** The Curator of Elder Library Quest
- **Type:** Wordcount, Collection
- **Requirements:** Write 4K words and collect Hunt Map Piece 4
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Tall Fur Boots
- **Recommendations:** This is basically "unlock next level" with a few nice shinies. I recommend.

### State of Rest

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: Guarding the Path
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Pipit
- **Rewards:** Hunt Map Piece 5, 5 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** We've settled into a pattern where one Ancient's Assistant quest unlocks another, which unlocks another, and provides Map Pieces to further the Hunt. Have fun getting to know Pipit and progressing in the Hunt! Don't forget to check off the Oh, Endless Possibilities quest when you're done!

### Oh, Endless Possibilities!

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: All Who Wander
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect Hunt Map Piece 5
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Facepaint Star (seven variations per cheek, 14 total): https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;670-hunt-facepaint-star-4091-65557.png
- **Recommendations:** The requirements for this quest are basically "complete State of Rest quest". It's really a two-for-one thing, in the end.

## Season 2 Quests - Strengthening Sideline

The first Season of the hunt had the Proving Your... questline; this seems to be the equivalent for S2. Waiting to see if this ends with an awesome wardrobe reward, too!

### Strengthening Your Loyalty

- **Unlocked by:** The Curator of Elder Library Quest
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Grult
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** EDITED 24 Apr 2020 - Suspicions justified! Currently 3 quests in this chain. Original recommendation: I'm suspicious. The naming convention sounds a bit like the "Proving Your..." series from Season 1 - will this become a series? Or does "wandering" mean fewer sequential things? It's a pretty small quest, in the end, and hey, Grult are the most efficient sources of XP in the game right now.

### Strengthening Your Viewpoint 2/3

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: Strengthening Your Loyalty
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each:
  - Rulo (3PC, Gansu)
  - Sparfly (Gansu, Riza)
  - Ylly (Gansu)
  - Desert Wignow (3PC, Gansu)
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** I KNEW IT! I knew Strengthening Your Loyalty was part 1 of a chain! If this is parallel to Season 1, then this quest chain will have mediocre rewards until it ends, at which point you might have some very cool wardrobe in store. Might. Anyway, I like that several of these monsters have valuable drops and none of them have requirements; go for it!

### Strengthening Your Friendship 3/3

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: Strengthening Your Viewpoint 2/3
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Wetu (Gansu)
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** 3 Wetu are a cinch if you're used to writing >1000 words/day; they're a bit more of a challenge if you're on the slower side. Feel free to wait and watch on this one.

## Season 2 Quests: Miscellaneous

### Wandering We Go

- **Unlocked by:** The Curator of Elder Library Quest
- **Type:** Streak
- **Requirements:** Maintain a 7-day Streak
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Pick it up and hang on to it!

### A Season to Explore

- **Unlocked by:** The Curator of Elder Library Quest
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each:
  - Frizi
  - Kiru
  - Grult
  - Desert Wignow
  - Rulo
  - Yasri
  - Bruja
  - Villager
  - Tambo
  - Lombri
- **Rewards:** 100 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** That's 100 Hunter Tokens. That's quite a bit. (Although I'd detour to Mama Tree to fight the Villager, since it's cheaper there.) Go for it! Pro tip: if you haven't finished the Desert yet, you've got plenty of Bruja, Kiru, and Yasri ahead of you; don't go out of your way to fight them. Grult doesn't appear in any other quests, though (apart from Hunt quests).

### Seeing It Through

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS1 Quest: The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Frizi
- **Rewards:** 5 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** This is a little quest with a little reward. However, if Frizi end up dropping Hunter Tokens at any point, this will be well worth it. 

### We Wander Together

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS1 Quest: The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Forum
- **Requirements:** Make at least 3 posts in the Forum
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** It's basically never a mistake to take up a forum quest, in my Oh So Humble Opinion, because the forums rock. Maybe I should make a list of all Forum Quests so you can plan overlap! (There's a few in the Hunt, one in Luciola, one in Mama Tree, and one in Riza...)
