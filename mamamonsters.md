Again, I'm not including Hunt monsters here. And again, numbers assume a certain amount of Luck. Some of these numbers were obtained only after a Luck of 20 (there are some monsters I skipped on the first playthrough). However, I believe these numbers are accurate enough to be helpful with a Luck of 4 or more, based on the differences for monsters played with multiple Luck levels.
