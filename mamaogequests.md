## Mama Tree Main Quests

### Main Quest 1: To Great Heights

- **Type:** Battle & Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Lorsa and craft 1 Lorsa Nest
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendations:** Lorsa are nice and straightforward. The Lorsa Nest probably won't take long to scrounge for: you'll need 6 Leaves, 2 Claws, 10 Wood, and 5 Rope, which you can get from fighting a Tylu (2-3 Claws and 1 Leaf), 3 Awas (6 Rope and around 5 Leaves and 4 Wood), and 4 Xin (around 7 Wood, plus extra Leaves), which is about 1600 words. Lorsa are also a nice source of Feathers if you want to go back to the LF Safety Hats quest.

### Main Quest 2: A Secret Message

- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 3 Essence, 5 Feathers, and 8 Dust
- **Rewards:** 1 Steel Dagger
- **Recommendations:** Between Lorsa and Wignow, you should be able to cover this easily even if your previous supplies aren't up to scratch. Remember that Wignow will help with the Watering Hole sidequest, too, if you picked that up. This conflicts with the Shaman's Hideout sidequest in that they have a lot of requirements in common, but still nice to do both.

### Main Quest 3: Elder Library

- **Type:** Battle 
- **Requirements:** Defeat the Search Party
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendations:** Search Party appears as a monster in the Wilderness during the span of this quest, and only during the span of this quest. And no, it doesn't drop anything. Just go ahead and power through when you feel up to it.

### Main Quest 4: Aid to an Elder

- **Type:** Battle 
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Assassins
- **Rewards:** Suwö as Companion, Three Points Crossing unlocks, Stone of the Forest
- **Recommendations:** Up your Luck before fighting Assassins, and they're more likely to give you Wooden Keys and Steel Daggers. Also, stick around and work on some sidequests after this, because Three Points Crossing can be demanding and it's nice to be stocked up first.

## Mama Tree Sidequests

LAST UPDATED 10 FEB 2021

A lot of these are available from the beginning. If there's an asterisk, it unlocked in the process of going through this region.

### A Family Tree

- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Battle 8 Tylu
- **Rewards:** 50 Coins, 1 Wood Spear, 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendation:** Take this one and knock it out! The Wood Spear is a nice weapon to have on hand at this stage.

### * Bridge of Sighs 

- **Unlocked by:** Mama Tree Main Quest 4/ Aid to an Elder
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 100 Wood and 50 Rope
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendation:** I'd recommend trying to make sure you still have a supply of 100 Wood and 100 Rope even after being done with this, so I wouldn't pick this up till you have close to 200 Wood and 150 Rope in stock. The rewards aren't worth nearly as much as the cost, but just finishing another quest can be satisfying.

### Collector

- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Have 30 Unique Items
- **Rewards:** 8 Core Crystals
- **Recommendation:** Grab immediately. Core Crystals are not to be shunned, and all you have to do is have this sit in your Questbook till you've found enough different Items in your inventory to fill it. (This usually doesn't take long, just following the main course of the game.)

### * Edrie's Informative Lorsa 

- **Unlocked by:** Mama Tree Main Quest 1/ To Great Heights
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect/Craft 10 Lorsa Nests
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendation:** Not really my cup of tea, but up to you. Be aware that there are quests identical to this one with different names later on, so it might be worth it to think in terms of "do I want to craft 30 Lorsa Nests or not". 

### Fair, Standard, Middling

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Mama Tree
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 25 Nitana, 25 Castu, 25 Rulo, 25 Illi, and 25 Tylu (all 400-700 word monsters)
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Expedition Tylu Belt
- **Recommendations:** This is a long-term quest that can't be completed until you get halfway through the main quest sequence in the Floating City of Balance, which is a long ways away. These monsters are all over Oge-Mai, not just the Forest Region. If you want to pick up the quest now so that any battles you have against the appropriate creatures count, go ahead; however, this may be worth saving until you run out of other things to do in the entire game, especially since the only reward is essentially bragging rights and a wardrobe item.

### Huge, Gigantic, Enormous

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Mama Tree
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 25 Lombri, 25 Rudakai, 25 Vezi, 25 Wetu, and 25 Tambo (all 1100-2000 word monsters)
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Expedition Tambo Belt
- **Recommendations:** This is a long-term quest that can't be completed until you get halfway through the main quest sequence in the Floating City of Balance, which is a long ways away. These monsters are all over Oge-Mai, not just the Forest Region. If you want to pick up the quest now so that any battles you have against the appropriate creatures count, go ahead; however, this may be worth saving until you run out of other things to do in the entire game, especially since the only reward is essentially bragging rights and a wardrobe item.

### Itsy, Bitsy, Teeny

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Mama Tree
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 25 Reenu, 25 Ardii, 25 Dandeleon, 25 Frizi, and 25 Puna (all 60-220 word monsters)
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Expedition Ardi Belt
- **Recommendations:** This is a long-term quest that can't be completed yet; some of these monsters are rather deep in the Expedition section that you can't unlock till after you finish Mama Tree, and one isn't available till you get to Three Points Crossing (though once you finish Mama Tree these should be pretty available). If you want to pick up the quest now so that any battles you have against the appropriate creatures count, go ahead; just bear in mind you'll be carrying it a while and it might get tricky to keep track of.

### * Keep In Quarantine

- **Unlocked by:** Mama Tree Main Quest 4/ Aid To An Elder
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Villagers
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendation:** The reward itself isn't worth the effort, but the Leaf Boot and Coin stockpile you'll get from fighting Villagers just might be worth it.

### Leafsung Vial Creation

NOTE: This quest is almost impossible to complete until you've completed Make Attacks Sing in Luciola Forest, which is unlocked by Make Words Sing, which is unlocked by Make Ink Sing. Make sure you've done those.

- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect/Craft 10 Leafsung Ink
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendation:** Don't bother unless you **really** feel like it. This does not, as far as I can tell, open any other quests, the reward isn't worth the price, and there are many, many other things later you might want to use Leafsung Ink for. They are later in the game, however, so if you're sitting on 9 bottles of Leafsung Ink from the LF quests and just desperately want to craft one more… it's your choice.

### * New Adventurous Horizons

- **Unlocked by:** Mama Tree Main Quest 4/ Aid To An Elder
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Tylu (also be min level 3, but if you're here, you'll be past level 3 anyway)
- **Rewards:** Unlock Base Camp in Expedition
- **Recommendations:** DO IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. Wandering around Expedition is fun, and it's important to know your way around the area if you want to get through the later parts of the main questline. Definitely worth it.

### * Sand Mountain Caravan

- **Unlocked by:** Mama Tree Main Quest 4/ Aid To An Elder
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Tambo
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest, 1 Wooden Key, 1 Leafsung Boots
- **Recommendation:** Think fighting a Tambo is intense? It is. But the rewards are great. You'll probably get a Wooden Chest for every Tambo you fight, and these are the only Leafsung Boots you'll get in the game without crafting them yourself. Do it if you can.

### Shaman's Hideout

- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 8 Essence, 3 Claws, 12 Dust
- **Rewards:** 5 Leaf Boots
- **Recommendation:** Why not? Essence are easy to get from Wignow, if you did A Family Tree you'll probably have enough Claws, Dust isn't used for a ton of things, and Leaf Boots are nice to have for battles.

### * Tinkering With Leafsung (1/5)

- **Unlocked by:** Mama Tree Main Quest 4/ Aid To An Elder
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Aracni, 5 Wignow, 5 Lorsa, 5 Mawt, and 5 Buhini
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest, unlock Inking By Number (2/5) (this is a 5-quest series which is actually not possible to complete until all Oge-Mai regions have been unlocked and most of the main quests completed)
- **Recommendations:** Go ahead and get started on this project if you want! The quest series culminates in a lovely Leafsung Ink Tattoo wardrobe item and gives nice little rewards along the way. Your difficulty at this stage will be finding Buhini: they are in the Expedition area, a bonus region. You will need to complete the New Adventure Horizons side quest to unlock the Base Camp in Expedition, and then you will *further* need to complete A Hard Day's Walk in Base Camp to unlock Forward Base in Expedition, and then Feeding the Lighthouse in Forward Base to unlock the ability to craft Ardi Lamps, and then Javelin Toss West to open Stone Trees, which is the home of Buhini. Whew. That was a lot. And that's not even getting into the materials and things you'll need to craft them. TL;DR: Take this at your own pace, no need to rush.

### * Inking By Number (2/5)

- **Unlocked by:** Tinkering With Leafsung (1/5)
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 15 Reenu Wings, 15 Feathers, 3 Tambo Mane, 10 Claws, and 50 Dust
- **Rewards:** 3 Wooden Keys, unlock Inking of Dust (3/5) (this is the last part of this 5-quest series which can be completed before unlocking the Water Region)
- **Recommendations:** If you're here, you've already finished Tinkering With Leafsung; might as well do the next step! Also gives you something to do.

### * Inking of Dust (3/5) - NOT POSSIBLE till Riza Rivertown is unlocked

- **Unlocked by:** Inking By Number (2/5)
- **Type:** Battle, Streak
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Patliadu, 15 Puna, 5 Wetu, and 1 Arenica, and have a minimum 15-day Streak at the time of turning in
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest, unlock Thinking Like Ink (4/5)
- **Recommendations:** This isn't possible to complete till you've made it to Riza Rivertown in the Water Region (one reason I'm not including it in Forest Resources), and again, this is a long-term quest sequence. I would recommend leaving it alone at least until you get to the Floating City of Balance, at which point it *might* be worth combining with other quests to save effort.

### * Thinking Like Ink (4/5) - NOT POSSIBLE till partway through the Floating City of Balance

Monsters and Resources listed here will not be linked with this quest outside the Water Resources and All Resources sections. If you want to know sources for these requirements, see the Water Resources or All Resources.

- **Unlocked by:** Inking of Dust (3/5)
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** 10 Vezi Shells, 15 Nuig String, 100 River Grass, 10 Dí Bags, and 5 Xyplos Ink 
- **Rewards:** 3 Leafsung Keys, unlock The Invisible Ink (5/5)
- **Recommendations:** Make no mistake, as wonderful as Leafsung Keys are, these particular ones aren't worth the ingredients on their own; it's all about working toward the Leafsung Tattoos in the end. And if some of the ingredients look unfamiliar, you're probably not far enough in the Floating City of Balance yet. But if you've gotten this far, it'd be silly not to see the whole thing through!

### * The Invisible Ink (5/5) - NOT POSSIBLE to complete till partway through the Floating City of Balance

Monsters and Resources listed here will not be linked with this quest outside the All Resources section.

- **Unlocked by:** Thinking of Ink (4/5)
- **Type:** Collection, Battle, Streak
- **Requirements:** Collect 5 Leafsung Ink and 20 Red Dye, defeat 1 Tambo and 3 Bruja, and have a minimum 30-day Streak when you turn it in
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Leafsung Tattoos (and yes, they're multicolor, but here's the baseline: https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;leafsung&#95;tattoo&#95;yellow.png )
- **Recommendations:** DOOO IIIITTTT. I might have mixed feelings about recommending the whole quest sequence to non-obsessive non-high-output people, but if you're here, you're SO CLOSE to rad tattoos. DOOO IIIITTT.

### Tribe Member

- **Type:** Forum
- **Requirements:** Post 5 Messages in the Forum
- **Rewards:** 8 Core Crystals
- **Recommendation:** This is your last chance to earn Core Crystals for quite a while, and it's so easy. Go for it! Make friends! Or post in one of the nonsense threads.

### Watering Hole

- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 44 Wignow
- **Rewards:** 4 Wooden Keys, 1 Steel Dagger
- **Recommendation:** Those Wignow are good munching, you'll get a valuable stockpile of Leaves and Essence out of it, go ahead and pick it up unless you hate Wignow.

### Warm Creature Highlights (1/3) - NOT POSSIBLE till Desert fully unlocked

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Mama Tree
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** 
  - Deliver:
    - 3 Red Dye
    - 5 Spider Poison
    - 5 Ardi Lamp
    - 10 Feathers
    - 10 Nezthai Claws
  - Defeat:
    - 5 Ripos
    - 3 Desert Rudakai
    - 5 Sapiti
    - 5 Tylu
- **Rewards:** 2 Bones Chests
- **Recommendations:** The quest description aptly warns you: **Advanced Quest - Must have Desert Expedition Areas unlocked to Complete**. The reward is fairly useless until you get to the Dust Region (at which point it's quite nice). So this is a late-game thing in practice, and you absolutely shouldn't bother until far later, when you know what these things are.
  That said, Ardi Lamps and Nezthai Claws are in Forward Base (see Travel Directions if you need help figuring out how to get there; it's in the Forest Expedition), Sapiti are in Stone City (ditto), and Ripos is in the Underground Ruins in the Desert Expedition. And if you can't figure out the rest, you probably haven't gone far enough in the game to worry about it.

### * Cool Creature Highlights (2/3) - NOT POSSIBLE till Dark Forest Outpost unlocked

- **Unlocked by:** Warm Creature Highlights (1/3)
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** 
  - Deliver:
    - 10 River Water
    - 25 Ardii Dust
    - 10 Lorsa Fur
    - 3 Xyplos Ink
    - 10 Dark Forest Leaves
  - Defeat:
    - 10 Gobkey
    - 5 Patliadu
    - 5 Xuso
    - 3 Vezi
- **Rewards:** 3 Bones Chests, 1 Bones Key
- **Recommendations:** You got past the first part - congrats! No mean feat. Now you'll get a key for your chests, and the Dark Forest Leaves have to come from the Dust. Good luck with the Xyplos Ink, too (remember Sliv can get it for you more easily than Xyplos if you have enough Luck), and good luck fighting the Vezi and good luck remembering that Gobkeys are way back in the Forest Expedition in Guardian's Lair. Go forth and conquer!

### * Creature Colors & Highlights (3/3)

- **Unlocked by:** Cool Creature Highlights (2/3)
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** 
  - Deliver:
    - 5 Dandeleon Flower
    - 8 Nuig String
    - 10 Essence
    - 3 Sacred Feathers
    - 3 White Fur
  - Defeat:
    - 3 Suulan
    - 3 Arenica
    - 10 Kaija
    - 10 Scofin
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Pride River Dye Hair https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;836-pride-siren-hair-5634-64111.png
- **Recommendations:** Look at the lovely hair! Isn't it wonderful? I'd rec attacking the monsters first, because the Suulan and Arenica will drop some of what you need. Dandeleon Flowers only come from Dandeleons and Night Dandeleons in the Forest Expedition, though, so you may have to travel for those (get the Kaija and Scofin in Base Camp and Tall Trees respectively). For Nuig String, make sure you've fought all the Castu quests from Balance that you want to fight, because Castu are a great source of Nuig String and they're really popular in Balance quests.

###The Winding Path to Elder Library

- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Tylu and 3 Illi
- **Rewards:** Unlock Elder Library; 100 Coins
- **Recommendations:** This is your first step into a larger world. Elder Library is the first Expedition area you can unlock - an area with quests, loot, and monsters independent of the main quests. And Elder Library hosts the Hunt for the Ancients, a perpetually-updating event with tons of fun quests and wardrobe and house items... DO THIS when you can! (And see if you can combine it with A Family Tree, if that interests you in the slightest.)

### Written Accounts

- **Type:** Words
- **Requirements:** Write 25,000 words
- **Rewards:** 100 Coins, 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendation:** Pick this up immediately and let it fill itself. Especially if you've just come over from finishing Luciola Forest: any words you've written the day you pick up the quest will count. (Downside: your Attack bonus doesn't affect how many words you have to write. It will be 25,000 regardless.)

## Luciola Sidequests Unlocked By Mama Tree

I'm not going to repeat all the Luciola sidequests here (you can go back and look at 'em), but I am going to list the new ones unlocked by Mama Tree quests.

### * Luciola Lorsa Nests

- **Unlocked by:** Mama Tree Main Quest 1/ To Great Heights
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect/Craft 3 Lorsa Nests
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendation:** As you please. Remember you'll have to craft your Lorsa Nests in Mama Tree.

### * Tinkering With Trinkets

- **Unlocked by:** Mama Tree Main Quest 2/ A Secret Message
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 5 Rusty Amulets and 5 Rusty Pendants
- **Rewards:** 50 Coins
- **Recommendation:** The numbers don't work in the slightest; the materials are easily worth 50 coins, especially now that Rusty Amulets no longer drop as rewards. But if it's satisfying, and/or if you're piling up more Rusty Pendants than you know what to do with, here you go.
