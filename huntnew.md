LAST UPDATED 24 MAY 2020

Hey! Loading up the info for the Hunt. It takes a while to incorporate everything properly throughout the Guide, but it doesn't take long to gather the new info. So! Here is New Info Only for the Hunt for the Ancients. (Please, please just look at the regular sections if you aren't up to the latest point; there's nothing here that will be likely to serve you before then.)

#FAIR WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD.

This month: May-June is bringing Season 2 to a near-close; if we imitate Season 1, June 24 will bring a boss battle and a collective goal to unlock Season 3 a couple days later. Or not! It remains to be seen...

## New Quests: May 2020

### Dazzling Desert Diversity

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS1 Quest: The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat:
  - 3 Loi
  - 2 Sakish
  - 2 Zera
  - 1 Kapir
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** The Strengthening quest chain involves Kapir in Part 5, so if you're planning on doing both, try to overlap those. There's no rush on this quest; you can take it at whatever pace you please.

### Strengthening Your Timing 4/5

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: Strengthening Your Friendship 3/5
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Ripos
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Pretty self-evident. If you manage to knock this out this month (before 24 June 2020), Ripos will be dropping Hunter Tokens, too, so it'll get you 28. Good time to tackle it.

### Strengthening Your Adaptiveness 5/5

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: Strengthening Your Timing 4/5
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Kapir
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Chest Side Belts https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;657-chest-side-belts-3903-85263.png
- **Recommendations:** Note that Kapir are also required for Dazzling Desert Diversity, so consider having that at the ready. Otherwise... you're good!

### No Wrong Path

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: Oh, Endless Possibilities!
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect Hunt Map Piece 6
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Facepaint Eye Shadow https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;664-hunt-facepaint-eye-shadow-4007-92291.png
- **Recommendations:** Yet another quest-that's-really-an-extra-reward-for-another-one. A Distant Figure quest will net you this. Go for it.

### Our Waymark Stones

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS1 Quest: The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 10 Raw Stone, 10 Raw Sandstone, and 10 Desert Stones
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** If you haven't completed the regular Desert Region quests, think carefully about this. These resources are fairly easy and quick to collect, but also required in maddening quantities in Oge-Mai Valley. However, they're mostly required in side quests, so as long as you're not giving away the last 10 of these items, you should be good to prioritize as you please.

### Battle of Merit

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS1 Quest: A Battle of Wills
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Velts: Desert
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** This is the only S2 quest that requires an S1 quest other than Curator of Elder Library (and the only S2 quest that can be completed without completing S1, for that matter). Make sure you're fighting the 3PC version of Velts if you want to tackle this. She's tougher than the Mama Tree version, but doable enough.

### A Distant Figure

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: State of Rest
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Lubu
- **Rewards:** Hunt Map Piece 6, 5 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** You know the drill by now. Defeat the Ancient's assistant, get the Hunt Map Piece. Don't forget to pick up and turn in No Wrong Path after you're done with this.
