LAST UPDATED 27 AUG 2020

Hey! Loading up the info for the Hunt. It takes a while to incorporate everything properly throughout the Guide, but it doesn't take long to gather the new info. So! Here is New Info Only for the Hunt for the Ancients. (Please, please just look at the regular sections if you aren't up to the latest point; there's nothing here that will be likely to serve you before then.)

#FAIR WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD.

This month: a wild Vanvri appears in Balance! As with our previous two months, this has no CLEAR connection to the Hunt, but I still find it interesting that these new monsters drop Hunter Tokens, and that they seem to be appearing in lieu of the Assistants in previous Seasons.

## New Quests: Aug 2020

### Quest

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** 
- **Requirements:** 
- **Rewards:** 
- **Recommendations:** The trend continues! Once again, the quest to get Hunt Map Piece 9 does not depend on the quest to get Hunt Map Piece 8. (One of my test accounts is in the interesting position of possessing Hunt Map Piece 9 and not 8.) Still, you'll need this to 

### Quest

### Battle of Constitution (3/4)

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: A Battle of Merit
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Velts: Water
- **Rewards:** 15 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Once again, this seems to actually be a chain independent of the Seasons. This is the first time the Battle chain has explicitly acknowledged being a chain. Presumably, the last Season will have its own Velts to battle. But it probably won't be visible till you complete this one, so take into consideration.

### MQ3

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: Bettering Ourselves
- **Type:** Collection, Streak
- **Requirements:** Collect Hunt Map Piece 9 & reach a 5-day Streak
- **Rewards:** 
- **Recommendations:** Still streaking! (Sorry, couldn't resist.)

### Growing Your Perception 2/3

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: Growing Improvement
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Castu, 3 Isartu, and 1 Water Rudakai
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** A lot here rides on how much you like the monsters, and how much you like the rewards. You'll probably want to see whether, as in previous Seasons, this questline culminates in a fifth quest with a nifty wardrobe reward. (I'm writing this just as this quest released and the chain is only three quests long; hopefully I remember to update when the answer drops next month.) In the meantime, you may want to keep up just to save time later, or you may want to take your time.

### Growing Your

## New Hunt Monsters: Jul 2020

I'm counting Vanspi as a Hunt monster here, and only here, because there's no indication that it's actually a Hunt monster apart from the fact that it was released at the same time as the Hunt.

**DISCLAIMER:** This is info based on ONE (1) battle. I'm actually avoiding integrating this into the Guide until I have time to give more battles (or if someone wants to battle for me and let me know the multiplier, drops, XP, and ideally also wordcount that results, I'd appreciate that too https://4thewords.com/forum/thread-oge-mai-field-guide )

### Vanvri (Oge: Balance)

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Three Points Crossing
- **Requirements:** Battle 20 Minutes Continuously
- **Multiplier:** Can multiply baseline rewards up to x4 depending on steadiness of words written
- **Baseline XP:** 60
- **Drops:** 
  - Baseline: 20 Coins, 2 Leaves, 1 River Water, 2 Hunter Tokens
- **Quests:** none



## New Resources: Jul 2020

### Hunt Map Piece 9

## Hunt Token Sources: Late Aug 2020

**Late Aug 2020 Sources Outside the Hunt:**

Late August 2020 sources are - wait for it - BLUE. 

... I am exhausted from the Expedition Explosion this month, so instead of my usual Hunter Token source list built after running a battle against every monster in the game, I'm going to simply list monsters that appear to fit the clue and have the Hunter Token icon in their drop list. Look up their wordcount and infer their drops as you will.
