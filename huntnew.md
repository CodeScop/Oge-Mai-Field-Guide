LAST UPDATED 9 DEC 2020

Hey! Loading up the info for the Hunt. It takes a while to incorporate everything properly throughout the Guide, but it doesn't take long to gather the new info. So! Here is New Info Only for the Hunt for the Ancients. (Please, please just look at the regular sections if you aren't up to the latest point; there's nothing here that will be likely to serve you before then.)

(Apologies that this is a bit delayed this month; a lot going on in my personal life, and a lot of work getting the Purple Gate release stuff set up.)

#FAIR WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD.

## New Quests: Nov 2020

###Still Missing Something

- **Unlocked by:**  HuntS4 Quest: Celebrate Joy
- **Type:** Streak, Collection
- **Requirements:** Attain 10-day Streak, have all 11 Hunt Map Pieces
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Map Hands https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;872-hunt-map-hands-6024-61497.png
- **Recommendations:**  Still waiting to see if/how this is impacted by the December release, because after all the waiting to finish this quest... nothing happens. At least, nothing happens right now. We'll see if that lasts!

###Sing Your Commitment (3/4)

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS4 Quest: Sing Your Bravery (2/2)
- **Type:** Streak
- **Requirements:** Attain a 15-day Streak
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  It's a bit tedious. But the satisfaction of cleaning out this chain...

###Sing Your Wander (4/4)

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS4 Quest: Sing Your Commitment (3/4)
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each: Wignow, Desert Wignow, Dust Wignow, Spirit Wignow, and Swamp Wignow
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Facepaint Around Eye https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;660-hunt-facepaint-around-eye-3951-47167.png
- **Recommendations:**  See what else you can get going for you while you're on this one. It involves a fair amount of travel, although 160 Coins will pay for you to make a one-way trip across the Valley, and 320 will pay for a round trip, so this might be worth shelling out for.

###Stories to Tell

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: A Bubble Dream
- **Type:** Wordcount
- **Requirements:** Write 25K Words
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** I am never one to turn down wordcount quests, because you can always add to them while you're doing other things.

###A Battle of Celebration

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: A Bubble Dream
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Morimet
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  Right now, this doesn't look like it actually does anything, since we have all the Hunt Map Pieces in hand; we'll see if that holds true once the Bard appears!

## New Hunt Monsters: Nov 2020

### Morimet

- **Location:** Underground Ruins
- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: A Bubble Dream

## Hunter Token Sources: Dec 2020

**Dec 2020 Sources Outside the Hunt:**

Note: I'm marking this as "December" instead of "Late November" because for the entire duration of NaNo, right through early December, Hunter Tokens were dropping from NaNo event monsters and Hunt monsters only.

For December, the trend is "Green and White".
