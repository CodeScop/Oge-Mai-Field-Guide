LAST UPDATED 25 JAN 2021

Hey! Loading up the info for the Hunt. It takes a while to incorporate everything properly throughout the Guide, but it doesn't take long to gather the new info. So! Here is New Info Only for the Hunt for the Ancients. (Please, please just look at the regular sections if you aren't up to the latest point; there's nothing here that will be likely to serve you before then.)

You may notice that a lot of the quests below don't specify how they're unlocked. That's because I don't know. They're not available to my temp account that's made it halfway through Season 1, and they are available to my temp account that's just started Season 4.

Also, my recommendations are tentative at the moment; without knowing what's behind or what's ahead any more than anyone else, it's hard to prioritize. Guesses only below!

#FAIR WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD.

## New Quests: Jan 2021

###The Winding Path to Elder Library

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** Opening Mama Tree
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Tylu and 3 Illi
- **Rewards:** Unlock Elder Library; 100 Coins
- **Recommendations:**  This is NOT OPTIONAL; you'll need to complete this quest to access anything else about the Hunt that you don't already have in your possession. The good news: lots of goodies ahead!

###Velts' Relaxation Method

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** ?
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Maikile, 1 Buholi, 1 Oncaiii, and 1 Nezthai
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  I suspect this is not all that important, but it's a nice way to make things count double!

###Velts' Strong Start

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** ?
- **Type:** Streak, Wordcount, Battle
- **Requirements:** Reach 10-day Streak, write 10000 words, defeat 1 Tambo
- **Rewards:** 2 Stempos and Wardrobe: Hunt Aging Eyebrows https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1529-hunt-aging-eyebrows-10437-30092.png
- **Recommendations:**  My *guess* (emphasis on "guess") is that this will be the start of another Velts chain for this season, so I'm happy to get it out of the way. Curious if my guess holds up!

###A Secret Plan?

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** ?
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Assassins & 1 Villager
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Eyepatch https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1532-hunt-cloth-eyepatch-10480-77717.png
- **Recommendations:**  Here, I'm torn between "this feels like a throwaway quest" and "but the lore hints sound important!" I'll just settle for "hey, look, Assassins drop lots of nifty things and make sure you fight the Villager in Mama Tree, where it won't cost you!"

###Familiar Assistants Needed!

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** ?
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 each Sassi, Alnu, Burocat, and Clawadin
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Aging Beard https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1526-hunt-aging-beard-10389-52135.png
- **Recommendations:**  This one REALLY feels like an optional sidequest, but we'll see! Could Velts's concern about the Assistants bode some change for the Curator this Season?

###Curator's Catalog Collections

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** ?
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 3 Essence, 1 Spider Poison, 3 Lorsa Fur, 1 Tambo Mane, and 5 Claws
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  This is mostly "put excess materials to good use", in my book; a lot of these materials will have been gathered with the quests to break into the Elder Library, so hurrah to that having a use for even experienced Hunt followers!

###Into Forest Depths 1/3

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** ?
- **Type:** Collection, Battle
- **Requirements:** Deliver 2 Saliva Vials and 2 Dandeleon Flowers, and defeat 3 Kaija, 3 Xuso, 5 Ardia, 5 Ardii, and 5 Ardis
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  You won't need to focus on Saliva Vials, since they'll pop up anyway while you're battling Kaija; if you've lost track, these monsters can be found entirely within Base Camp and Forward Base (or you can skip FB and battle Ardi-beasts in Mama Tree, if you've done the FB quest unlocking them!)

###Into Forest Depths 2/3

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Into Forest Depths 1/3
- **Type:** Collection, Battle
- **Requirements:** Deliver 5 Dinti and 1 Spider Poison; defeat 5 Reudod, 3 Oncaiii, and 1 Finoir
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Facemask https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1534-hunt-neck-guard-10523-15955.png
- **Recommendations:**  Here, we move from BC and FB to Stone City and Tall Trees. The Spider Poison will pop up when you fight Oncaiii anyway; you will get some Dinti from Finoir, but might want to fight its tiny Scofin cousins to rack up more. (Or you might have plenty from the Alien Expedition.)

###Into Forest Depths 3/3

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Into Forest Depths 2/3
- **Type:** Collection, Battle
- **Requirements:** Deliver 2 Gobkey Trinkets, 2 Dandeleon Flowers, and 2 Essence; defeat 5 Gobkey, 5 Dandeleon, and 5 Maikile
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens and House Item: Hunt Shield Ornament https://4thewords.com/public/hideouts/hideout&#95;element&#95;322&#95;30102/variant&#95;icon&#95;1197&#95;737.png 
- **Recommendations:**  Hey, first House Item reward!!! (It can also be crafted in the Hunter Token Store if you want a more detailed look at it.) You'll definitely get all your resources during your battles, which are largely in Guardian's Lair. (I wonder if the Forward-Base-dwelling Dandeleon was originally a Guardian's-Lair-dwelling Night Dandeleon? If so, the switch was kind to users; Night Dandeleons disappear during the day, but their cousins are available 24/7.)

## New Hunt Monsters: Jan 2021

- none

## Hunter Token Sources: Jan 2021

**Jan 2021 Sources Outside the Hunt:**

For January, the clue is an image in the news announcement: https://4thewords.com/forum/details-325 The image looks like a torn rectangle of creamy parchment with a dark red color painted over most of it, and a much darker reddish-brown cursive capital L.
