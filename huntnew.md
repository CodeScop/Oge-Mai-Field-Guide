LAST UPDATED 29 AUG 2020

Hey! Loading up the info for the Hunt. It takes a while to incorporate everything properly throughout the Guide, but it doesn't take long to gather the new info. So! Here is New Info Only for the Hunt for the Ancients. (Please, please just look at the regular sections if you aren't up to the latest point; there's nothing here that will be likely to serve you before then.)

#FAIR WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD.

This month: a wild Vanvri appears in Balance! As with our previous two months, this has no CLEAR connection to the Hunt, but I still find it interesting that these new monsters drop Hunter Tokens, and that they seem to be appearing in lieu of the Assistants in previous Seasons.

## New Quests: Aug 2020

### Insight Grows

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 20 Puna
- **Rewards:** 15 Hunter Tokens & Hunt Map Piece 9
- **Recommendations:** The trend continues! Once again, the quest to get Hunt Map Piece 9 does not depend on the quest to get Hunt Map Piece 8. (One of my test accounts is in the interesting position of possessing Hunt Map Piece 9 and not 8.) Still, you'll need this to keep the main Hunt line going, so I suppose it's worth the Puna. (There are approximately 423,293,478 Puna quests in the game, and after completing all of them, I'm rather tired of the fishies. For those who have not completed them, I recommend checking out what quests overlap, especially in Balance.)

### Bigger and Brighter

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: Bettering Ourselves
- **Type:** Collection, Streak
- **Requirements:** Collect Hunt Map Piece 9 & reach a 5-day Streak
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Facepaint Trident https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;665-hunt-facepaint-trident-4021-27616.png
- **Recommendations:** Still streaking! (Sorry, couldn't resist.) And as of this writing, still waiting to see what gets unlocked next by this one! But the Caretaker will almost certainly require this quest to unlock.

### Change To See

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Yala
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** ... you'll complete this anyway if you complete Growth in Friendship, so it overlaps well. If you can't do Growth in Friendship because you haven't unlocked Raina, this is a nice consolation prize.

### Growth in Friendship

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each: Rea & Pira, Yala, Knusha, Vota, Vaktra, Droxa, Begala
- **Rewards:** 50 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** This pairs really well with at least one Surface Camp quest, so keep an eye out for that. Just.... don't fight any of these monsters in Riza, because you'll be paying more Resources than you would fighting them in Raina.

### Where Life Flows

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 50 Swamp Moss
- **Rewards:** 15 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Swamp Moss is available in the deeper parts of Raina, if you have trouble finding it. And while I wouldn't belabor myself to fill this up, it's a nice use for the Swamp Moss one tends to accumulate in Raina.

### Growing Your Valor 4/4

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: Growing Your Tenacity 3/3
- **Type:** Battle 
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Wyvern
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Fur Ankle Boots https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;Boots&#95;Ankle&#95;Fur&#95;Black.png
- **Recommendations:** I'm personally quite fond of Wyverns, so for me this is a no-brainer. Given that it's unlocked. I don't think I'd rush through the "Growing" line for this.

## New Hunt Monsters: Jul 2020

I'm counting Vanspi as a Hunt monster here, and only here, because there's no indication that it's actually a Hunt monster apart from the fact that it was released at the same time as the Hunt.

**DISCLAIMER:** This is info based on ONE (1) battle. I'm actually avoiding integrating this into the Guide until I have time to give more battles (or if someone wants to battle for me and let me know the multiplier, drops, XP, and ideally also wordcount that results, I'd appreciate that too https://4thewords.com/forum/thread-oge-mai-field-guide )

### Vanvri (Oge: Balance)

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Three Points Crossing
- **Requirements:** Battle 20 Minutes Continuously
- **Multiplier:** Can multiply baseline rewards up to x4 depending on steadiness of words written
- **Baseline XP:** 60
- **Drops:** 
  - Baseline: 20 Coins, 2 Leaves, 1 River Water, 2 Hunter Tokens
- **Quests:** none



## New Resources: Jul 2020

### Hunt Map Piece 9

- **Source:** HuntS3 Quest: s (1)
- **Sell price:** 10 Coins (DO NOT SELL, irreplaceable)
- **Used for:** HuntS3 Quest:  (1)

## Hunt Token Sources: Late Aug 2020

**Late Aug 2020 Sources Outside the Hunt:**

Late August 2020 sources are - wait for it - BLUE. 

... I am exhausted from the Expedition Explosion this month, so instead of my usual Hunter Token source list built after running a battle against every monster in the game, I'm going to simply list monsters that appear to fit the clue and have the Hunter Token icon in their drop list. Look up their wordcount and infer their drops as you will.
