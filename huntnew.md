LAST UPDATED 25 JUL 2020

Hey! Loading up the info for the Hunt. It takes a while to incorporate everything properly throughout the Guide, but it doesn't take long to gather the new info. So! Here is New Info Only for the Hunt for the Ancients. (Please, please just look at the regular sections if you aren't up to the latest point; there's nothing here that will be likely to serve you before then.)

#FAIR WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD.

This month: we have a new monster in 3PC that seems related to the Hunt, or maybe not! For the time being, I'm going to assume Vanspi belongs in the regular game (since you don't need the Hunt to access them)

## New Quests: Jul 2020

### Flying Past Sparks

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Nuig
- **Rewards:** Hunt Map Piece 8, 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** The Season of Growth seems to be favoring us with a gentler way to obtain Hunt Map Pieces so far - we do NOT need to complete Moving Flora to unlock this quest. Still, we do need to complete this one to continue on the Hunt Map Pieces chain, so let's dig in.

### Problems Feed Solutions

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 20 Caricaco
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Check out other Caricaco quests in Balance before completing this. There's a reason the info for this quest references "Tambo Snacks". "River Walkers" is also worth doubling up with this.

### Of Vibrant Growth

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Wordcount
- **Requirements:** Write 10K Words
- **Rewards:** 15 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** I will always recommend wordcount quests, because they will always fill themselves without you having to think about it. Win/win.

### Battle of Constitution (3/4)

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: A Battle of Merit
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Velts: Water
- **Rewards:** 15 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Once again, this seems to actually be a chain independent of the Seasons. This is the first time the Battle chain has explicitly acknowledged being a chain. Presumably, the last Season will have its own Velts to battle. But it probably won't be visible till you complete this one, so take into consideration.

### Bettering Ourselves

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: To Grow & Change
- **Type:** Collection, Streak
- **Requirements:** Collect Hunt Map Piece 8 & reach a 5-day Streak
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Complex Brooch https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;651-hunt-complex-brooch-3813-44800.png
- **Recommendations:** The Season of Growth is certainly encouraging us to build our Streaks!

### Growing Your Perception 2/3

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: Growing Improvement
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Castu, 3 Isartu, and 1 Water Rudakai
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** A lot here rides on how much you like the monsters, and how much you like the rewards. You'll probably want to see whether, as in previous Seasons, this questline culminates in a fifth quest with a nifty wardrobe reward. (I'm writing this just as this quest released and the chain is only three quests long; hopefully I remember to update when the answer drops next month.) In the meantime, you may want to keep up just to save time later, or you may want to take your time.

### Growing Your Tenacity 3/3

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: Growing Your Perception 2/3
- **Type:** Battle 
- **Requirements:** Defeat 2 Xyplos
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Same as the previous quest: depends whether it appeals and whether you like the prospect of the end of the questline.

## New Hunt Monsters: Jul 2020

I'm counting Vanspi as a Hunt monster here, and only here, because there's no indication that it's actually a Hunt monster apart from the fact that it was released at the same time as the Hunt.
