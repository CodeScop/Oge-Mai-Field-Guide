LAST UPDATED 27 FEB 2021

Hey! Loading up the info for the Hunt. It takes a while to incorporate everything properly throughout the Guide, but it doesn't take long to gather the new info. So! Here is New Info Only for the Hunt for the Ancients. (Please, please just look at the regular sections if you aren't up to Season 2; there's nothing here that will be likely to serve you before then.)

My recommendations are tentative at the moment; without knowing what's behind or what's ahead any more than anyone else, it's hard to prioritize. Guesses only below!

#FAIR WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD.

## New Quests: Feb 2021

###Curator's Catalog Cache (2/2)

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** HuntS1.2 Quest: Curator's Catalog Collections (1/2)
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 5 each Nezthai Claws, Saliva Vials, Gobkey Trinkets, and Rusty Pendants
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  Huh, hadn't figured that there would be a series with these collection quests. (Note that when Part 1 came out, it wasn't labeled as such.) The Gobkey Trinkets are easy to get, and the Rusty Pendants will gradually accrue as you open chests in Mama Tree (with decent Luck); Saliva Vials are easy to farm but increasingly widely used, and Nezthai Claws are something you'll already need quite a few of to complete all the quests this round. But if that's not off-putting, go for it!

###Base Camp Clearing Duty

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** HuntS1 Quest: The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Xuso, 10 Sacer, and 5 Kaija
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  This'll help you get the Saliva Vials for the Curator quest part 2, and dovetails well with Into Forest Depths.

###Dynamic Disappearing Duo

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** HuntS1 Quest: The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 2 Rudakai and 2 Wignow
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  At the moment, I'd say the quest needs to be evaluated on aesthetic grounds, because on mercenary grounds it's useless, but it's kinda fun to beat up on the monsters that steal boots in the lore (Wignow) as well as the monsters that actually cost boots to fight (Rudakai).

###Great Library Cleanup!

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** HuntS1 Quest: The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Illi and 6 Kuay
- **Rewards:** 15 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  These are great sources of Rope and Wood, so you'll get something out of this quest other than the prize (Illi has a few quests you'll overlap with, also), but maybe wait till one or both are dropping Hunter Tokens to make this truly profitable.

###Sticky, Sweet, and Alluring

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** HuntS1 Quest: The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 15 Reenu and 5 Nitana
- **Rewards:** 15 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  For the love of the flight (convenient that this quest is released when flying monsters are dropping Hunter Tokens!) Go for it!

###Tallest of Trees

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** HuntS1 Quest: The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Buhini, 5 Buhovi and 3 Buholi
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens and Wardrobe: Hunt Earrings Sword Shield https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1588-hunt-earings-sword-shield-11798-73484.png 
- https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;-hunt-earings-sword-shield-11800-77162.png
- **Recommendations:**  Bear in mind that you'll need 29 Nezthai Claws to complete this, which will probably mean 20-25 Nezthai battles as well, few of which will involve other quests. On the other hand, you get those really nifty earrings (you can switch which ear gets which earring, too, although it always has to be both and they always have to be different). Make sure there aren't any Buh-beast quests you want to do at the same time!
