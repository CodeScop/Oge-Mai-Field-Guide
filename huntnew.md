LAST UPDATED 25 MAR 2021

Hey! Loading up the info for the Hunt. It takes a while to incorporate everything properly throughout the Guide, but it doesn't take long to gather the new info. So! Here is New Info Only for the Hunt for the Ancients. (Please, please just look at the regular sections if you aren't up to Season 2; there's nothing here that will be likely to serve you before then.)

My recommendations are tentative at the moment; without knowing what's behind or what's ahead any more than anyone else, it's hard to prioritize. Guesses only below!

#FAIR WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD.

## New Quests: Mar 2021

###Gentle, Magical Being

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** HuntS1 Quest: The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Mirdor and deliver 10 Wood, 10 Rope, and 3 Spider Legs
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  Read the quest description carefully: you won't be able to find the Mirdor until you've opened the Bard's domain of the Hunt, making this the only HuntS1.2 quest that requires having progressed to the Hunt Season 4. If you haven't gotten that far yet, rejoice in the fact that you'll be able to dovetail this quest with Season 4 requirements. :)

###Close to Home

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** HuntS1 Quest: The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Villagers
- **Rewards:** 100 Coins, 15 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  none needed! Self-explanatory.

###Mawt Shading Practice

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** HuntS1 Quest: The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Grey's Mawt and 5 Mawt
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  none needed! Self-explanatory.

###Forward Base Swarm 1/2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** HuntS1 Quest: The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 50 Each Ardia, Ardii, and Ardis
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Ardi Belt https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;989-ardi-belt-7180-77015.png (has variants in the colors of Ardia, Ardii, Ardis, and Spirit Ardia)
- **Recommendations:** Really, in and of itself, this is a pretty self-evident quest. If you have one of the sidequests that require hundreds of Ardi* Dust, this is a nice way to generate it. And if you want to evaluate based on the quest chain, you can read ahead to the next quest on your own. :)

###Forward Base Swarm 2/2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Forward Base Swarm 1/2
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 25 Wood, 25 Rope, 3 Steel Bars and 3 Stone Blocks
- **Rewards:** 100 Coins and 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  And that's it for this one. No secrets, not tricks here.

###Curator's Catalog Curios (3/3)

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Curator's Catalog Cache (2/2)
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 3 White Fur, 10 Spider Poison, 10 Essence, 5 Dust, and 5 Rusty Amulets
- **Rewards:** 50 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  It's possible that you may have unlocked this and have no idea what White Fur is, since it doesn't become available until you've unlocked most of the Desert. (And it's also possible that you've gotten deep enough in the game on multiple levels to have unlocked a source of White Fur right here in the Forest Region.) For the rest of it, there are no magic tricks or surprises; just do your best and remember that you can always work on a collection quest without having it take up space in your questbook.
