LAST UPDATED 24 APR 2020

Hey! Loading up the info for the Hunt. It takes a while to incorporate everything properly throughout the Guide, but it doesn't take long to gather the new info. So! Here is New Info Only for the Hunt for the Ancients. (Please, please just look at the regular sections if you aren't up to the latest point; there's nothing here that will be likely to serve you before then.)

#FAIR WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD.

This month: April-May is going to be a little different, it looks like, because we're not going to be shifting our Hunter Token sources until the Raina Festival ends. More for us to figure out later!

## New Quests: Apr 2020

### State of Rest

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: Guarding the Path
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Pipit
- **Rewards:** Hunt Map Piece 5, 5 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** We've settled into a pattern where one Ancient's Assistant quest unlocks another, which unlocks another, and provides Map Pieces to further the Hunt. Have fun getting to know Pipit and progressing in the Hunt! Don't forget to check off the Oh, Endless Possibilities quest when you're done!

### Oh, Endless Possibilities!

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: All Who Wander
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect Hunt Map Piece 5
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Facepaint Star (seven variations per cheek, 14 total): https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;670-hunt-facepaint-star-4091-65557.png
- **Recommendations:** The requirements for this quest are basically "complete State of Rest quest". It's really a two-for-one thing, in the end.

### Seeing It Through

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS1 Quest: The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Frizi
- **Rewards:** 5 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** This is a little quest with a little reward. However, if Frizi end up dropping Hunter Tokens at any point, this will be well worth it. 

### We Wander Together

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS1 Quest: The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Forum
- **Requirements:** Make at least 3 posts in the Forum
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** It's basically never a mistake to take up a forum quest, in my Oh So Humble Opinion, because the forums rock. Maybe I should make a list of all Forum Quests so you can plan overlap! (There's a few in the Hunt, one in Luciola, one in Mama Tree, and one in Riza...)

### Strengthening Your Viewpoint 2/3

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: Strengthening Your Loyalty
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each:
  - Rulo (3PC, Gansu)
  - Sparfly (Gansu, Riza)
  - Ylly (Gansu)
  - Desert Wignow (3PC, Gansu)
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** I KNEW IT! I knew Strengthening Your Loyalty was part 1 of a chain! If this is parallel to Season 1, then this quest chain will have mediocre rewards until it ends, at which point you might have some very cool wardrobe in store. Might. Anyway, I like that several of these monsters have valuable drops and none of them have requirements; go for it!

### Strengthening Your Friendship 3/3

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: Strengthening Your Viewpoint 2/3
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Wetu (Gansu)
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** 3 Wetu are a cinch if you're used to writing >1000 words/day; they're a bit more of a challenge if you're on the slower side. Feel free to wait and watch on this one.
