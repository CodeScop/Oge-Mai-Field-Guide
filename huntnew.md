LAST UPDATED 5 JUL 2020

Hey! Loading up the info for the Hunt. It takes a while to incorporate everything properly throughout the Guide, but it doesn't take long to gather the new info. So! Here is New Info Only for the Hunt for the Ancients. (Please, please just look at the regular sections if you aren't up to the latest point; there's nothing here that will be likely to serve you before then.)

#FAIR WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD.

This month: We have something unusual: new monsters and a quest released globally, to people outside the Hunt, and NO new monsters in the new Hunt area. I'll be including the End Of S2 quests/monsters as well as the Start Of S3 quests.

## New Quests: Jun 2020

### Stumbling Upon Sheep

- **Unlocked by:** Hunt S2 Quest: No Wrong Path
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Shepherd
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Dog Mentor Pet https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;862-dog-mentor-pet-6004-63771.png
- **Recommendations:** This is the end of the Season 2 quests! And the Pipit pet is ADORABLE. Beat that Shepherd down!

### Moving Flora

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Streak
- **Requirements:** Reach 5 Streak days in a row
- **Rewards:** Hunt Map Piece 7, 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Pick up, hang on, beat out! We're in the rhythm now, and ready to keep going!

### To Grow & Change

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Collection, Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 of any monster, collect Hunt Map Piece 7
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Facepaint Side https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;667-hunt-facepaint-side-4049-28215.png
- **Recommendations:** Make sure you've got the Moving Flora quest, and this will mostly handle themselves!

### Valley Of The Sheep (NOTE: Now Missing!)

- **Unlocked by:** Opening the Game
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each: Attleas, Shashi, Imali
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** This is unusual in that it's offered **in the Global Quests instead of the Hunt Quests**. (At least, as of this writing on 26 Jun 2020; it disappeared on 1 Jul 2020 and I haven't been able to spot it since. We'll see if it reappears.)

### Herding the Herders

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: No Wrong Path (?)
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each: Lubu, Czanus, Pipit
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** This is entirely voluntary and unlocks nothing, but it's fun. Not 100% positive which of the major quests unlocks it (it might also be unlocked a little sooner, by A Distant Figure), but you get the gist.

### Helping Those In Need Grow

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver:
  - 10 Rusty Amulets
  - 5 Rusty Pendants
  - 1 Gold Bar
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Unless you have 10 Rusty Amulets just lying around, I wouldn't hurry on this. (Ditto on Rusty Pendants and Gold, but you're more likely to actually have them lying around.) The Hunter Tokens just aren't worth as much in and of themselves. Still, fun little thing to do!

### Growing Improvement

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Jaihri
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Check out the list of quests Jaihri have to their name - there's quite a few! This will dovetail with a lot of quests in the regular game.

### Growth Pains

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat:
  - 3 Osaril
  - 2 Trainees
  - 1 Furoxi
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** This can dovetail with a few Riza Rivertown quests, but otherwise, no hurries. Take at your own pace.
