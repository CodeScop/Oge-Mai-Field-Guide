LAST UPDATED 26 OCT 2020

Hey! Loading up the info for the Hunt. It takes a while to incorporate everything properly throughout the Guide, but it doesn't take long to gather the new info. So! Here is New Info Only for the Hunt for the Ancients. (Please, please just look at the regular sections if you aren't up to the latest point; there's nothing here that will be likely to serve you before then.)

(Apologies that this is a bit delayed this month; a lot going on in my personal life, and a lot of work getting the Purple Gate release stuff set up.)

#FAIR WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD.

## New Quests: Oct 2020

### Ideas Brought to Life

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: A Bubble Dream
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Weekiwa
- **Rewards:** Hunt Map Piece 11, 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** You know the drill. Weekiwa is clearly a water entity, so my subtle hint dovetails with the quest description to point you to look in water communities.

### Celebrate Joy

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS4 Quest: Dirt to Dust
- **Type:** Streak, Collection
- **Requirements:** Have Hunt Map Piece 11 and attain 7-day Streak
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Facepaint Eye Stroke https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm_666-hunt-facepaint-eye-stroke-4035-59139.png 
- **Recommendations:** We're continuing on, and we're gonna make it. Almost to the end of the Hunt Map Piece collecting/turning in!

### Sing Your Bravery (2/2)

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS4 Quest: Sing Your Enthusiasm
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Cursed Hands
- **Rewards:** 15 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** As of this writing (quest has just been released), this is still the last quest in this chain and I don't know whether the chain will be worth any more than its obvious merits. Make your choices!

### Jubilant and Strong

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: A Bubble Dream
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 100 of any monster
- **Rewards:** 50 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Look! 50 Hunter Tokens for taking up a quest spot while you're doing other things! Not a bad deal... also easy to pick up later, if you'd rather. :)

### On the Wrong Path

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: A Bubble Dream
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Infected Golem
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** This one requires monsters from midway through the Purple Gate, and it's entirely optional for progressing the Hunt. (It also dovetails with at least one PG quest.)
