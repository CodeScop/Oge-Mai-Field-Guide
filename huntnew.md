LAST UPDATED 15 OCT 2020

Hey! Loading up the info for the Hunt. It takes a while to incorporate everything properly throughout the Guide, but it doesn't take long to gather the new info. So! Here is New Info Only for the Hunt for the Ancients. (Please, please just look at the regular sections if you aren't up to the latest point; there's nothing here that will be likely to serve you before then.)

#FAIR WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD.

## New Quests: Sept 2020

### A Bubble Dream

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: Bigger and Brighter
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Caretaker
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Cactus Sprite Pet https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;861-cactus-sprite-pet-6003-60430.png
- **Recommendations:** This is part of the trail to get through the Hunt. Note that the Caretaker is in Dark Forest Outpost...

### A Battle of Evolution

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: Battle of Constitution
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Velts: Dust
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Battle Helmet https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;634-hunt-battle-helment-3693-42038.png (7 variants)
- **Recommendations:** Shockingly, Dust Velts is to be found in the Water Region, possibly enjoying DÃ­ at Luko's Inn. As far as I can tell, this is the end of the quest chain, but this Velts has particularly nice drops (especially if you've recently opened Raina, or really any area beyond Riza).

### Something Extraordinary

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: A Bubble Dream
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Mirdor
- **Rewards:** Hunt Map Piece 10 and 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** The description for this quest will outright tell you that Mirdor is in Guardian's Lair. The Bard seems to be all over the game!

### Dirt to Dust

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: A Bubble Dream
- **Type:** Streak, Collection
- **Requirements:** Have Hunt Map Piece 10 and attain 5-day Streak
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Golden Brooch https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;652-hunt-golden-brooch-3827-31075.png
- **Recommendations:** What's to lose by picking it up? And it lets you continue with the Hunt!

### Cheer Your Dedication

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: A Bubble Dream
- **Type:** Wordcount, Forum
- **Requirements:** Write 10,000 words and make 5 posts in the Forum
- **Rewards:** 15 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** I always recommend participating in the forum, and the 10K will happen as you go. Take it!

### Sing Your Enthusiasm

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: A Bubble Dream
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Zanthei
- **Rewards:** 20 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** I think Team Zanthei is getting a shoutout here! If you pick this up while Zanthei is dropping Hunter Tokens, those tokens will add up to effectively triple the reward on this quest.

### To Celebrate and Share

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: A Bubble Dream
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 6 Takori
- **Rewards:** 20 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** I'm not sure what Takori have to do with celebration (unless we're celebrating escaping them?), but hey, ours is not to question why, right?

### Into the Woods

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: A Bubble Dream
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Molox, 4 Osalyu, 10 Spirit Ardia, 1 Lycosta, 1 Chaensi
- **Rewards:** 50 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** A very challenging quest, which I completed for completionism's sake alone. This dovetails with multiple Dark Forest Outpost quests, but otherwise, there's no rush to grab it.
