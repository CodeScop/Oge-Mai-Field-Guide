**Y'ALL. YOU CAN GET A WHITE FUR AND A SACRED FEATHER BY BATTLING ONE (1) SULANICA.**

(If you're still early in the game, you may not realize how valuable this is. It's valuable. Not quite quit-pursuing-the-event-and-just-battle-Sulanica valuable, but... it wouldn't be crazy to prioritize getting a half a dozen battles done before the event ends. I suspect that when Sulanica appears permanently, it'll be in an area past where it's most wanted.)

This section is solely for info that's changed during this phase (as best I can tell.) Skip down to ALL to see the comprehensive list of everything.
