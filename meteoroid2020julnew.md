LAST UPDATED 5 JUL 2020

This section is solely for info that's changed during this phase (as best I can tell.) Skip down to ALL to see the comprehensive list of everything. (... once I get to it. The event opened today, the new and the comprehensive are the same thing for now.)

## New Quests: Spaceship Arrives - Jul 4

New To Pick Up ASAP:

- **An Alien Exam**: Same as One Rocky Start, it's good to have this kind of broad quest in the background, if you have the space. Be aware that Dr Hogglevoss and Ame are not yet with us (should be available after the Research Lab is built; construction starts Monday 6 Jul)

AND ON TO THE REPORTS!
