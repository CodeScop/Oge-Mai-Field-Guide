## Three Points Crossing Main Quests

### Main Quest 1: Earthquakes

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Three Points Crossing
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Yasri, 3 Kiru, 1 Lombri, and 1 Bruja
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest
- **Recommendations:** You'll need a Wood Spear to spend on the Lombri battle; they come relatively cheap if you head back to Mama Tree and open a Wooden Chest. (And it's never too early to start collecting Vine Nets from those chests if you want to complete all sidequests in the game.) Take your time with these, explore, and consider which sidequests you value. 3PC is much more intense, generally, than prior regions. Also, most of the quests are collection-oriented. It never hurts to stock up on textiles, Xin/Awa drops, and steel. ALSO: Do NOT use or sell any Raw Fabric, Fine Fabric, or Red Dye received in drops during this quest until you finish Main Quest 3.

### Main Quest 2: Just Another Brick

- **Unlocked by:** 3PC Main Quest 1/Earthquakes
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 8 Stone, 30 Wood, 4 Steel, and 10 Rope
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest
- **Recommendations:** Shouldn't take too long, especially if you notice that Rulo drop full-fledged Stone Blocks without you needing to craft them. If, like me, you tend to run low on Wood, remember that it's always better to grind Xin or head to the Forest before you seek other options. 

### Main Quest 3: Camouflage

- **Unlocked by:** 3PC Main Quest 2/Just Another Brick
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Get 6 Fine Fabric, 10 Raw Fabric, and 4 Red Dye
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Desert Facemask
- **Recommendations:** I hope you saved your drops from the first quest, because if you did, you probably have at least most of what you need already. Otherwise, I recommend fighting Yasri; they're a source of all the materials you need, and 6 Yasri battles should cover all your bases. You could also fight Bruja for Red Dye, Frizi for Raw Fabric, and Desert Wignow for Essence to get all you need to craft Fine Fabric instead, but that's far more time-consuming; I'd only do that if 900-word Bruja are THAT MUCH more appealing than 1250-word Yasri.

### Main Quest 4: A Desert Army

- **Unlocked by:** 3PC Main Quest 3/Camouflage
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Fight 5 Assassins
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest
- **Recommendations:** They're Assassins. Exactly the same as Mama Tree. (In fact, if you went back to Mama Tree and fought Assassins there, it would count the same.) Assassins will disappear from Three Points Crossing once you deliver this quest, so if (like me) you like milking Assassins for Wooden Keys, it might be worth fighting a few extra while they're around before delivering the quest. (Also, the Steel Daggers they drop will be useful in the next region; you'll probably want at least a dozen.)

### Main Quest 5: A Way South

- **Unlocked by:** 3PC Main Quest 4/A Desert Army
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Get 20 Wood, 10 Rope, 20 Leaves, 5 Raw Fabric, 1000 Coins, Min Level 10
- **Rewards:** Gansu Watering Hole & Azadi as Companion
- **Recommendations:** Most of these materials are simple: "fight Xin and Awa". And while you're fighting Xin, sell River Grass like there's no tomorrow. (We're approaching the time when you'll need River Grass, same as you've discovered uses for Raw Fabric, but it's still pretty safe to sell down to zero.) This is a good time to skim through the various sidequests and figure out what else you might want to collect at the same time. 

## Three Points Crossing Sidequests

LAST UPDATED 11 FEB 2020

### Explore the City

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Three Points Crossing
- **Type:** Streak
- **Requirements:** Maintain a 5 day Streak, starting with the day you pick up the quest
- **Rewards:** 1 Gold Bar & 1 Glass Bar
- **Recommendations:** Go ahead and pick it up immediately! Nothing to lose, a Gold Bar and Glass Bar to gain. This is currently the only Streak quest in the game, too.

### Fan the Flames

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Three Points Crossing
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 100 Wood and 50 Leaves
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest and 3 Leafsung Keys
- **Recommendations:** Leafsung Keys are really, really valuable; apart from the Bi-weekly Monster Hunter quests, there aren't many in the game. If you like Xin and Awa, this is a cinch for something to Do Immediately. If not, it's still something to prioritize, but DO NOT PURCHASE WOOD OR LEAVES FOR THIS. Grind them all you want, but 3PC's main quests require over 1000 Coins; it's unlikely that you can spare any.

### Sand in Places...

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Three Points Crossing
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 50 Dust, 12 Reenu Wings, 35 Raw Fabric, 3 Rope, and 1 Steel Bar
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Caravan Sandals https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;featured&#95;sandals.png
- **Recommendations:** I love me my Caravan Sandals. I think they are the cutest wardrobe items available so far in the game. If they're not all that from your perspective, this is definitely skippable (for now - if you ever want to comprehensively complete the game, your avatar will need these sandals). Bear in mind that you'll be wanting half a dozen Reenu Wings for other things later on, so you might want to go back and restock if this breaks the bank.

### Sands of Time

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Three Points Crossing
- **Type:** Collection/Crafting
- **Requirements:** Collect 10 Sands Rings and 5 Glass Staffs
- **Rewards:** 5 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** Unless you're desperate for Stempos (lovely lovely streak-holders), this might be better to save until after Gansu Watering Hole. Later Chests drop materials that make part of this quest much easier. Meanwhile, you can start stocking up on the 10 Old Staffs you'll need to craft the Glass Staffs; Mama Tree Wooden Chests are especially good for Old Staffs (and again, you can't have too many Vine Nets from there if you want to complete all quests in this game).

### Tailor

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Three Points Crossing
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 30 Red Dye
- **Rewards:**1 Fabric Boots, 3 Stone Keys, 1 Stempo
- **Recommendations:** Definitely do this, but I wouldn't actively pursue it till you're done with the Three Points Crossing Main Quests. Red Dye tends to slowly accumulate as you play, and you'll get a better feel for the best sources as you work your way around the Desert. (Oh, and if you're wondering what Stone Keys areâ€¦ they're Keys, what more do you need to know right now???)

### Written Accounts

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Three Points Crossing
- **Type:** Words
- **Requirements:** Write 75,000 Words (Attack Bonuses Do Not Count)
- **Rewards:** 3 Gold Bars
- **Recommendations:** Take this immediately, as with all wordcount quests. You'll automatically be working on them no matter what else you do. Free Gold!

### * Written Accounts: Attack on 3 Points

- **Unlocked by:** Written Accounts
- **Type:** Words
- **Requirements:** Write 50,000 Words (Attack Bonuses Do Not Count)
- **Rewards:** 2 Golden Chests
- **Recommendations:** Same as with the last Written Accounts (though you will have to turn in the previous Written Accounts before this even appears as an option). What do you have to lose?

### We Lucky Few

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Three Points Crossing
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 8 Rusty Amulet, 8 Rusty Pendant, 20 Dust
- **Rewards:** 3 Leafsung Keys
- **Recommendations:** This could get pricey, but Leafsung Keys are rare. Save it for when you're headed for the Forest anyway, and remember that Mama Tree Wooden Chests will give you Rusty Pendants AND other useful Quest goodies.

### Zilya's Defensive Lorsa

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Three Points Crossing
- **Type:** Collection 
- **Requirements:** Collect/Craft 10 Lorsa nests
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest
- **Recommendations:** You have SO MANY other uses for Wood (and Leaves, for that matter) besides building Lorsa Nests right now. Go ahead, if it makes you happy; you'll have more opportunities to build Lorsa Nests later, too. I wouldn't prioritize this.

### * Lighten the Load

- **Unlocked by:** 3PC Main Quest 5/A Way South
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Get/Craft 15 Leafsung Wooden Swords and 15 Leafsung Boots
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest
- **Recommendations:** I'd Turn Back If I Were You. This is where Leafsung Ink first starts to show its ugly intensity. Crafting these 30 items involves 30 vials of Leafsung Ink, which in turn involves 150 Spider Poison (or in other words, 150 Aracni battles; possibly 120, if you spread it out and have a couple dozen Wooden Chests/Keys from Daily Quests supplementing), 150 Essence, 90 Claws, and 90 Dust, apart from the Wood Swords and Leaf Boots and Leaves involved. One little Golden Chest won't come near to replacing the resources you spend on it.

### * Guard Your Feet

NOTE: This quest isn't possible to complete until you reach Riza Rivertown. Given the intensity of its prerequisite, I would guess you're not expected to unlock it until then. I'll therefore completely ignore this for now in Resources, and come back to it when we get to Riza Rivertown.

- **Unlocked by:** Lighten the Load
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Get 10 Steel Boots and 10 Steel Axes
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest
- **Recommendations:** Did you have a lot of fun with Lighten the Load? Totally your cup of tea? Great! You get to do a lot of the same thing again. Because to make 10 Steel Boots (and at least 9 of them *will* need to be crafted, probably all 10), you'll need the same 30 vials of Leafsung Ink you needed last time (you're getting so good at this!) because you need 10 Fabric Boots to create 10 Steel Boots, and you need 30 Leafsung Boots to create 10 Fabric Boots. You might be able to knock it down to 24 Leafsung Ink if you throw in the Fabric Boots from the Tailor quest and the one Steel Boots you can win from a quest later, but then you'll have no Fabric Boots and no Steel Boots of your own after a lot of grinding. AND YET this isn't as bad as the game gets. If you're running out of quests and getting bored, go ahead and why not.

### * Luciola Materials

- **Unlocked by:** 3PC Main Quest 5/A Way South
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Get 15 Feathers, 10 Spider Legs, 5 Lorsa Fur
- **Rewards:** 5 Red Dye
- **Recommendations:** If you haven't finished the Tailor quest yet, here's 5 Red Dye for (relatively) cheap! If you have, here's a chance to restock a bit! Go for it! Remember Lorsa in Mama Tree are the only sources of Lorsa Fur worth mentioning, and that they also drop Feathers.

## Mama Tree Sidequests Unlocked By 3PC

### Iron On Sand

- **Unlocked by:** 3PC Main Quest 2/Just Another Brick
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 25 Steel Bars
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest, 1 Wooden Key, and 1 vial Leafsung Ink
- **Recommendations:** It's nice to get a matched Chest/Key set, and Leafsung Ink is always amazing, but bear in mind that the game requires literally hundreds of Steel Bars eventually. And 3PC is by far the easiest place to get them, so it won't get easier to grind them. So it depends on whether your reaction to that is "eh, what's another 25?" or "NOT A SINGLE ONE MORE THAN NECESSARY". 

## Luciola Forest Sidequests Unlocked By 3PC

### It's Bigger Inside

- **Unlocked by:** 3PC Main Quest 2/Just Another Brick
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 5 Stone Blocks, 5 Sandstone Blocks, 5 Steel Bars, and 5 Glass Bars
- **Rewards:** 3 Wooden Keys
- **Recommendations:** Consider coming back to this one later. You may well find that in the process of grinding other quests, you get a lot of the raw materials for this almost accidentally. Though if you have a lot of Wooden Chests you can't open, this might be worth prioritizing.

### Enter Pan's Labyrinth

- **Unlocked by:** 3PC Main Quest 5/A Way South
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Get 20 Wood Hammers, 10 Rope, 3 Steel Bars
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest & 1 Wooden Key
- **Recommendations:** Great way to use extra Xin and Awa materials if you like Xin and Awa. (I don't, so for me Wood Hammers are waaaayyy too expensive to make this quest worth the grind.) Save for when you're between more compelling quests.
