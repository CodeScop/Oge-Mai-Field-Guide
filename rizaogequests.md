## Riza Rivertown Main Quests

### Main Quest 1: Jaihri Dam

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Riza Rivertown
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 6 Jaihri
- **Rewards:** 100 Coins
- **Recommendations:** Make sure to pick up the River Dams sidequest at the same time to double up the Jaihri quest credit.

### Main Quest 2: Attack of Opportunity

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 1/Jaihri Dam
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 2 Yasri, 1 Bruja, and 2 Kiru
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest
- **Recommendations:** I honestly might go back to 3PC to fight these guys and stock up on the Quest 3 materials while at it. You'll need at least 10 Steel later, at least 3 Leaf Boots, a bunch of Rope, and weird things like Reenu Wings and Spider Poison. But by now, you've fought enough of these guys to know whether you want to stick around and how you want to approach them.

### Main Quest 3: Remedy for a Friend

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 2/Attack of Opportunity
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 6 Spider Poison, 6 Reenu Wings, 3 Desert Stone, 3 Glass Shards, 3 River Stones, 5 River Grass
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest
- **Recommendations:** It is what it is. The good news: this is the last Main Quest for a while that has requirements that might send you back to other regions.

### Main Quest 4: Mucky, Murky, Muddy

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 3/Remedy for a Friend
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 2 Jaihri, 4 Vota, 6 Yala, and 3 Knusha
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Key
- **Recommendations:** Mix and match as you see fit. This is straightforward.

### Main Quest 5: This Might Sting

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 4/Mucky, Murky, Muddy
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat Wyvern
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest
- **Recommendations:** I <3 the Wyvern. 24 hours to get 1300 words? And the drops? A lot simpler than the last one, and a welcome break before the next one.

### Main Quest 6: Journey Upriver

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 5/This Might Sting
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Gather 25 Hardwood, 10 Steel, and 5 Dí Bags
- **Rewards:** Floating City of Balance
- **Recommendations:** Dí Bags are usually easier to buy outright than to collect enough River Water to make. (And you'll be doing at least 3 more soon.) But if you want to do it the less-coin-intensive way, Yala are probably your best River Water source. (Osaril may be slightly more productive, but Vine Nets are harder to farm to get them). Hardwood is best gotten from Jaihri, hands down, and that'll help with the River Dams sidequest if you've been doing that.

## Riza Rivertown Sidequests

LAST UPDATED: 13 SEPT 2020

If there's an asterisk, it unlocked in the process of going through this region.

### Amateur Fisherman

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Riza Rivertown
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Patliadu
- **Rewards:** 25 Coins
- **Recommendations:** Completing this opens up another quest that can net you a Stone Key. Otherwise, it doesn't have anything to recommend it except a sense of satisfaction in Completing The Things. If you want to also do Battle Ready and/or Osaril Nests, do them first for maximum Harpoon efficiency.

### Battle Practice

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Riza Rivertown
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Trainees
- **Rewards:** 3 Stone Keys
- **Recommendations:** 1000 words in 60 minutes is no joke; doing it 10 times over is a real challenge. 3 Stone Keys are a really nice reward, though. I'd recommend picking this up, and if the pace is too punishing, write offsite and give yourself a little extra time. Trainee drops are good enough to make up for the extra effort, IMHO.

### Battle Ready

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Riza Rivertown
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Have at least 10 Harpoons in Inventory (and keep after turning in the quest!)
- **Rewards:** 25 Coins
- **Recommendations:** Do it. You get to keep the Harpoons, you will almost certainly want the Harpoons for hunting Patliadu at some point, and they're great Weapon2s anyway. If you do the Osaril Nests first, though, you'll get a couple Harpoons that way.

### Osaril Nests

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Riza Rivertown
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Osaril
- **Rewards:** 2 Harpoons
- **Recommendations:** Great for helping with the Battle Ready quest, and for hunting Patliadu with Amateur and Apprentice Fisherman; not-so-great use of Vine Nets, which suddenly look a lot more precious if you take up the giant later-game sidequests that require 120 of them. If you have a sane sense of proportion and can pace yourself, though, there's no reason not to do it.

### River Dams

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Riza Rivertown
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 15 Jaihri
- **Rewards:** 100 Coins
- **Recommendations:** Pick it up immediately; you'll be fighting 8 Jaihri for Main Quests anyway, and might as well get credit for them. (Though if you want to be hyper-efficient and also hyper-completionist, wait to fight the other 7 Jaihri till you open Raina Surface Camp and pick up the Jaihri quest there.)

### River Grass Supply

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Riza Rivertown
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Gather 50 River Grass
- **Rewards:** 1 Steel Boots
- **Recommendations:** This is probably an easy win, and the cheapest way to get Steel Boots in the game. However, if you don't have a ton of River Grass on hand, consider saving it till the end of Riza. There's no penalty for waiting, and you'll have a better sense of supply then.

### Water Tribe Member

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Riza Rivertown
- **Type:** Forum
- **Requirements:** Make 100 Forum posts
- **Rewards:** 15 Core Crystals
- **Recommendations:** DO IT. It will take approximately FOREVER. (Good news: you don't have to keep it in your Questbook. It counts all the forum posts you've ever made, no matter how many times you drop the quest while you're doing it.) Then you'll get to know everyone in the forums, which is fun! So yes, do it, but don't worry about officially picking it up except when you want to check how close you are to turning it in.

### * Apprentice Fisherman

- **Unlocked by:** Amateur Fisherman
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 8 Patliadu
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Key
- **Recommendations:** Go for it! If you're planning on doing Osaril Nests, though, make sure you do it first: the Harpoons will be helpful in the Patliadu battles. And do the Battle Ready quest first. You'll get to keep the Harpoons you gather for it, and can then use them on Patliadu.

### * Water Tribe Stripes

- **Unlocked by:** Apprentice Fisherman
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 15 Patliadu
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Water Tribe War Paint
- **Recommendations:** Depends on where you are in the game, and in how much of a hurry. 15 Harpoons might be a lot right now, or they might be dirt cheap. Personally, I think the Water Tribe War Paint is worth it.

### * Steel Weapons

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 3/Remedy for a Friend
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Craft & turn in 5 Steel Maces and 10 Steel Shields
- **Rewards:** 3 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** Biggest resource suck up to this point in the game. Even for completionists, I'd wait until all Main Quests were finished before tackling this one. Probably most of the sidequests, too. Much better to craft a Steel Mace to use yourself.

### * Raina Surface Camp

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 6/Journey Upriver
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Yala and 5 Vota
- **Rewards:** Unlock Raina Surface Camp
- **Recommendations:** Do it! This area is a lot of fun, and a lot of water resources are marginally easier to grind in the Raina Expedition.

### * Barge Weights

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 6/Journey Upriver
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Gather 35 River Stones
- **Rewards:** 2 Stone Keys
- **Recommendations:** Grab it! The Floating City of Balance has places to get River Stones more easily than Riza; it's worth the effort.

### * Dí Production

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 6/Journey Upriver
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Gather 10 Dí Bags
- **Rewards:** 1 Stempo
- **Recommendations:** Do… do you really want to do this? It's up to you. When I repeat the game multiple times, it's pretty easy to scrounge up 6500 Coins to buy this and cash out. But there are so many cheaper ways to get Stempos, and so many better uses for the resources it takes to get Dí. Completionists only, and I'd save for later even then.

### * New River Barge

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 6/Journey Upriver
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Get 25 Hardwood, 10 Steel, 10 Wood, 8 Rope, 15 River Stone, and 5 Raw Fabric
- **Rewards:** 5 Stone Keys
- **Recommendations:** Five Stone Keys. FIVE STONE KEYS. Weigh that against the costs, but… FIVE STONE KEYS. Totally worth it for me. 

### * Spider Bows

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 6/Journey Upriver
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Turn in 25 Spider Bows
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Key & 1 Stone Chest
- **Recommendations:** Definitely worth turning in if you have 25 Spider Bows or more already. If you're going to tackle the Raina quests, you'll probably accrue all the Spider Bows you need later while using Wooden Chests in Mama Tree to get Vine Nets. Probably no reason to specifically farm Spider Bows for it, though.

## Gansu Sidequests Unlocked by Riza

(none)

##3PC Sidequests Unlocked by Riza

None, but it's worth noting that it's now possible to do the **Guard Your Feet** quest that we looked at earlier.

## Mama Tree Sidequests Unlocked by Riza

### River Water For…?

- **Unlocked by:** Riza Main Quest 6/Journey Upriver
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 10 River Water
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest, 1 Wooden Key, & 1 Leafsung Ink
- **Recommendations:** Do you have extra River Water lying around after all the Dí requirements in the main quests? Then sure! Otherwise, give it a pass for now.

### Quench a Thirst

- **Unlocked by:** Riza Main Quest 6/Journey Upriver
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 25 Dí Bags
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest & 1 Wooden Key
- **Recommendations:** Hard pass until you finish the main game and move on to finishing up the corners; this is a waste of resources right now.

##Luciola Sidequests Unlocked by Riza

### Little Forest Lake

- **Unlocked by:** Riza Main Quest 6/Journey Upriver
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 20 River Grass and 10 River Stones
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendations:** As it please you. Just remember that if you do Raina Surface Camp, you may at one point want 1,000 River Stones or more, and you may regret spending any before that sum is accrued. (The weapons you can craft with the River Stones are beautiful.)
