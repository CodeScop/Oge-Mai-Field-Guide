# Whole Guide

(Intro last updated 11 Feb 2020)

Welcome to the Oge-Mai Valley! If you're an old hand here, you can skip ahead to the region-by-region guides. If you're a newbie, might I recommend making sure you've tried the demo first? It's right here: https://4thewords.com/demo . And there's a more comprehensive intro/description here: https://4thewords.com/forum/guides . And the forum is an amazing resource, and there's an FAQ here: https://4thewords.com/forum/thread-faq.

But if you're reading this intro, you've probably hunted through those. You may have tried the wiki, which as of this writing seems to be a little disorganized and incomplete still. And if you, like me, can remember the wonderful days when Lady Grayish had a complete guide to the site, you may be missing a bit.

So I've decided to try to make a more organized guide to Oge-Mai valley. This is the result of months of number-crunching and investigations, and if you don't mind spoilers and want to look at raw data for playing through the entire game, you can check out MAinsel's progress here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1t6K2YXLOB&#95;Hutz8goYlefp&#95;-ka10OmkL It's a bit of a mess and a bit cryptic, and some parts of the journey have changed somewhat since MAinsel traveled it, but at least you can go into the kind of nitty-gritty detail I wanted when I first found this game and got past the first few sections.

This is structured mostly by **game progress.** That is to say, the Luciola Forest review will *not* include everything that can ever be found in Luciola Forest, because some quests and monsters are unlocked by later regions. This means there **will be errors**, because ultimately I can only estimate what causes certain quests to be unlocked. But please feel free to add comments to improve! Especially in the forum thread: https://4thewords.com/forum/thread-oge-mai-field-guide 

I will be trying to keep this current. To help you figure out how current it is, I start each file with a LAST UPDATED with the date of the most recent edit. (There are... a lot of files in the game, usually multiple files per section, so you may see a lot of LAST UPDATEDs.) I also have a section at the end called STATE OF THE GUIDE where I post info about any changes worth noticing.

Enough disclaimers and details. On to the Guide!

# Luciola Forest

LAST UPDATED 11 FEB 2020

Welcome to the start of the game! So happy to see you've made it here!

I've got three major chunks of info in this section:

- A list of all the sidequests available when you start the area, complete with recommendations about whether to pick them up now and tips for completing them. **Note that this does not include the Hunt for the Ancients, which I cover in the next section.**
- A list of all the monsters available when you start, along with what they drop.
- A list of the main quests in the main questline and a little advice on how to tackle them

I have similar options at the start of every area. The Summary section goes deeper, including all the sidequests and monsters unlocked by the time you've unlocked the next area, and also listing all the resources available in the area and where to get them. And a few other things, but more on that later.

I strongly recommend pausing and clicking around the Game area to see everything you can find. You never know when it will come in handy!

Onward!

# Mama Tree

LAST UPDATED 19 MARCH 2019

Welcome to Mama Tree! I hope you saved some Wooden Chests and Keys from Luciola; if not, no big deal, they'll show up again, but opening a Wooden Chest in Mama Tree gives you some shiny new Battle items at low cost. If you haven't already geared up, see if you can make sure you have a Leaf Helmet, Leaf Boots, Wood Sword, and Spider Bow (and possibly a Rusty Amulet and Leaf Breastplate) from Luciola. Keep your eyes peeled, because a few new monsters have new requirements and rare items available. Don't stop to craft everything you see, unless crafting is your joy; most items in Mama Tree are more expensive to craft than they're worth.

Ready? Let's go!

# Forest Expedition

LAST UPDATED 11 FEB 2020

The FOREST EXPEDITION. This is the first part of the game where you have a choice. You can skip this section entirely and forge ahead with the Main Quests in Three Points Crossing if you want. **I recommend sticking around and exploring Expedition a bit first**, though.

If you haven't already unlocked Base Camp, you'll need to make sure you complete **New Adventurous Horizons** in Mama Tree to do so. It might be a little difficult to find Base Camp on your map if you have several areas unlocked. Note that all Expedition areas are listed in their own section below.

**As soon as you open Base Camp, go there and start the Hard Day's Walk quest**. Among other things, this quest requires a three-day writing streak to complete, and it is the key to unlocking the remainder of Forest Expedition. Getting that out of the way early will let you progress in the main game.

**Once you get to Forward Base, complete the Feeding the Lighthouse quest.** It's key to unlocking the quests that let you find the rest of the Forest Expedition; if you don't complete it, you might never realize how much of the Forest Expedition you're missing.

But apart from all that? **I'd actually recommend skipping the Guide entirely for this section**. Go on, and don't come back here till you get to the Desert or something where you really need the Guide. Because the Expedition is most fun to take on exactly those terms: as an expedition, exploring new territory. Take it easy.

But if it's driving you crazy, go ahead and take a peek!

Expedition areas are so much smaller and simpler than Oge-Mai areas that I'm combining all 5 of the Forest Expedition areas into one section. **If you're having trouble figuring out the sequence to unlock the different regions, check out the Travel Directions section of the guide.**

# Three Points Crossing

LAST UPDATED: 19 MAR 2019

Welcome, traveller! This is your first stop outside the Forest Region; welcome to the Desert. You'll have to plan your trips back to the Forest carefully to save the cost of travel, whether you pay in time or in coins.

While you're travelling, you're free to battle and write, but you are not free to add to your Battle Queue.

Technically.

In practice, if you're fighting a monster which exists both in your original area *and* the destination area (such as the globally available Xin and Awa), you'll be able to hit "Fight Again" just fine at the bottom of your Write screen.

I hope you brought plenty of Wood Spears, and that you have plenty of Wood and Rope with you; these resources are useful and relatively scarce here.

# Alien Expedition

LAST UPDATED 12 SEPT 2020

Whew! Fighting those Tambo to get here was rough, wasn't it? Don't worry, the quests get harder. :P

In seriousness, this Expedition is a bit like the terrain in its artwork: really easy slides downhill, really tough climbs up a cliff, surprising tunnels leading to unusual rewards. There are real gems buried deep in here, but it's a lot of work and a lot of time to get them. (Some quests require materials all the way from the distant Dust Region!) And there are a few easy gems scattered about, ready for the gathering.

Let's go see what those aliens have in store for us! It's not too hard to unlock all the areas, after all. Might be interesting.

# Gansu Watering Hole

LAST UPDATED 31 MARCH 2019

Welcome to Gansu, where the stakes grow higher! (I discovered a loophole in the Main Quests that allows you to make a killing before you leave if you exploit it. Please follow along my Main Quest info for clarity.)

So that you can make the most of this time, I strongly suggest that you make sure your Luck is up to scratch. It's tentative, but my research suggests that +18 Luck is the tipping point that almost guarantees every drop, every time (though in varying quantities still). Now that you're out of Three Points Crossing and have Azadi, this is very achievable. 

TECHNICAL EXPLANATION: Azadi gives you +10 Luck (and +5 Attack, which means she covers my two fave stats.) You can easily snag another +8 by having a Glass Necklace as Accessory and a Leaf Helmet for the Head. You probably already have a Leaf Helmet somewhere in your gear. Glass Necklace can be gotten in one of two ways. 

- One: go back to 3PC and craft it out of 2 Rusty Pendants, 2 Glass Bars, 1 Steel Bar, and 75 Coins. 
- Two: Complete the Watering Hole Puna Quest. This will give you a Stone Key and unlock the Gansu Watering Hole Puffs Quest, which has a Stone Chest as its reward. Complete that one too, and then open the Stone Chest. You're almost guaranteed a Glass Necklace along with other goodies.

I prefer Option Two because I like Chests and completing quests, and those two quests are relatively quick and simple, but YMMV. Or you might want to piece together your own gear combo. Gansu Watering Hole is the only region in the game without any new Battle Items of any kind, so you can go back to the previous region to see all currently-available gear, or you can check out what MAinsel had logged as available at this stage of the game: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hBFjQYFfLe66s3qpN2f8xcxH9tRThJG9CbyJy5UOIi0/edit#gid=199447042

So! Now that that's done, on with the show!

# Desert Expedition

LAST UPDATED 21 MAR 2020

Okay! If you haven't found it already, the way to unlock this section is by completing **Diggy Diggy Hole in Gansu**.

Just like the Forest Expedition, the Desert Expedition is **almost** entirely optional; you can skip past Dig Site and go straight on to Riza. There's nothing in the Water Region that needs anything from the Desert. I make no promises about after that, though...

Now, the Desert Expedition is special because it contains the Shrine of Ages, a special area that regularly changes its offerings. **The Shrine of Ages will not be featured in this section. It gets its own special section later on**, because like the Hunt for the Ancients it changes a little too much to fit in with other areas. (And unlike the Hunt for the Ancients, it's actually a separate area, and isn't accessible to anyone.)

Ready for the kitchen sink? Here goes!

# Riza Rivertown

LAST UPDATED 9 SEPT 2020

Welcome to the Water Region! Welcome to the world of insanely complex, time-consuming sidequests (and you thought Sands of Time was intense!), strange, exotic creatures, and a totally different feel. Also, the occasional spectacularly cool prize.

As you work your way through Riza, remember a few things: 

1) You WILL need to travel back to other zones sometimes. Consider planning that ahead, and use the Guide to help create a shopping list.

2) Riza in particular has several sidequests that wait very well. Don't be in a rush to Complete Them All, especially since a lot of Water Region-specific resources are cheaper to get when later zones are available.

Good luck, and bon voyage!

# Raina Expedition

LAST UPDATED 9 SEPT 2020

Welcome to the Raina area, y'all! (I'm going Southern with the swamp theme. Or because I like to use "y'all".) This is the most linear Expedition yet, with exactly one path from start to finish, but it's also one of the richest and most rewarding areas. Also one of the most complex. There are long, involved quests well worth the effort (I love the fact that the Infected Raina questline unlocks the ability to craft my fave weapons in the game), and there are long, involved quests not worth a T-shirt saying "all I got was this lousy T-shirt". But please do feel free to explore. 

# Floating City of Balance

 LAST UPDATED 5 OCT 2019

Welcome to the Floating City of Balance! 

This one has a slower start than other regions. It takes a few quests before it really feels populated. Don't worry, the population will explode then. Just... don't worry about the poor selection of sidequests and monsters at the start. And enjoy what you have. There are some real treasures here, and just like the sea, there's far more going on underneath.

Because I always covet Shiny Armor, I recommend going straight for the Reinforced Steel Breastplate, expensive as it is (a sidequest later in will give you a cheaper way to get a Reinforced Steel Helmet than building it, and it's worth holding out for that). (I was very excited when the Reinforced Steel Helmet provided the very first armor with Attack capability.)

You will eventually need quite a few Water Masks, so if you take the time to craft them when you have the materials, you may save yourself effort in the long run.

And as always, feel free to travel. The Water Region is very dependent on the other Regions for materials. Must be all that Dust in the area.

# Dark Forest Outpost

LAST UPDATED 5 OCT 2019

Welcome to the Dark Forest Outpost! Spooky scary skeletons and ghosts and things that go bump in the night...

... and a wide range of prior region resources needed to complete it. Expect a fair amount of travel, and be patient with it. Make sure you know the Forest Expedition and Desert Expedition areas (or just sneak a peek at the Main Quests to get a more specific idea of what you'll need; you may want to make a shopping list before settling in to the Dark Forest Outpost).

Definitely look at the sidequests to pick up quickly so you don't duplicate effort, and be on the lookout for at least one sidequest that appears elsewhere in the game just in time to double-dip requirements on the Main Quest line. (I'm more explicit in the Main Quest instructions, but for those avoiding spoilers, we'll keep it vague here.)

There's a decent amount of shiny new battle gear here, but I might recommend holding off on crafting Dark Forest Boots, since it's worlds cheaper to wait and see if they'll drop from a Bones Chest, even though it might take several Chests before that happens.

Enjoy the Dark Forest! And then enjoy the way it allows you to see the rest of the Valley with new eyes!

# Purple Gate

 LAST UPDATED 26 OCT 2020

Welcome to the Purple Gate! We approach the edge of Oge-Mai, and there's no telling what lies beyond.

I will admit to hoping that the Purple Gate does not stay quite the same as it is as I write this, because as I write this it has a lot of fantastic wardrobe-oriented quests and excellent battle-oriented quests and... not a lot of variety.

But the STORY. I shall not spoil it for you.

There's not a lot of ways to go wrong for the Purple Gate - the monsters and quests are extremely self-explanatory, so **I'm foregoing the usual intro monsters and intro quests info**. You know the drill with these quests by now.

And Purple Gate's release is a little... unusual. By the time you finish, you'll see why I'm not including all the info from the Purple Gate release here. I do, however, have complete spoileriffic info in the Dust Region summary sections.

Good hunting! Don't let the Dust get you down!

# Cave

LAST UPDATED 12 FEB 2021

Is the coast clear? *checks side to side* 

I'm going to guess "yes".

See, this section dropped at the exact same time as the Purple Gate, but entirely unannounced. I've been treating the existence of the Cave as a spoiler for five months. But I think, at this point, it's no more a spoiler that the Cave exists than any other Area, and I can separate its info out from the rest of the Dust Region.

Whew!

So, much like the Purple Gate, there isn't a lot of use for the Guide here; the sidequests are generally self-explanatory (I can't see any point to making special recommendations here) and the rewards are generally wardrobe items that impact strategy exactly as far as you care about them. But again, the STORY! I wholeheartedly recommend.
