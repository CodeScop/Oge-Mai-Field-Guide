LAST UPDATED 9 DEC 2020

Okay! So, I'm going to try to consolidate ALL THE QUESTS in this region. Everything that isn't a Main Quest will be listed in alphabetical order after the Main Quests. The Main Quests will be in order, since it's a clearly defined road; and that "road" metaphor will extend in multiple directions. Hence, the new "Route" line of info to tell you how to find it/where you picked it up.

**The Main Quest Highway** is the main questline of the game, the backbone which unlocks everything else. This line, and only this line, will be defined solely by where it is in the sequence; the Route will tell you where it is in that sequence (LF MQ 3 for the third Main Quest in the Luciola Forest sequence, etc)

**The Expedition Trails** branch off of this Main Quest Highway (so does the **Hunt Trail**) at defined locations. The Route will tell you where it branches off the Main Quest Highway (i.e. which Main Quest unlocks the sidequest that unlocks the Expedition/Hunt) and list out all quests on that Trail. So the quest Joining the Hunt, located in Luciola Forest on the Hunt Trail would read "Hunt Trail Route: (available from game open) • **HuntS1 Joining the Hunt** • HuntS1 The Hunt Begins" etc.

**Quest Paths** are basically a questline off to the side, which don't lead anywhere in particular. To save myself space, they'll be allowed to jump off of Expedition Trails as well as Main Quests. So the quest Battle of Merit, which is unlocked by a quest which is unlocked by The Hunt Begins, would look thus: "Quest Path Route: (open via Hunt Trail HuntS1 The Hunt Begins) • HuntS1 A Battle of Wills • **HuntS2 Battle of Merit** • HuntS3 Battle of Constitution • HuntS4 A Battle of Evolution"

**Lone Quests** are quests which are unlocked by something on the Main Quest Highway or a Trail; instead of a Route, these will simply have an "Unlocked by" field.

And to help keep all these straight... well, there's three options. You can check out the Questline listing and nesting quests for the whole game, or you can see the Travel Directions section for the Highway and Trails in more detail than you may want, or you can see the helpful quick list down at the very bottom of the page.

Here goes nothing!

# Main Quests, in Order of Unlocking

### LF Main Quest 1: Luciola Forest Caretaker

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Main Quest Highway:** LF MQ1
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Fight 4 Wignows (total: 1000 battle words)
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendation:** Go ahead and polish this off, then go play around! There's a lot of fun exploring to do. Monsters, sidequests... Don't forget to return to your Questbook (or the Current tab in your Lore book) to deliver the quest when you're done!

### LF Main Quest 2: Building, Not Burning

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Main Quest Highway:** LF MQ2
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect materials for Kyiat's Bridge - 2 Rope, 2 Spider Legs, 6 Wood
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendation:** This one can be a little tricky, because it's not enough to collect the materials (Rope is easiest to find with Awa, Spider Legs with Aracni, and Wood with Xin, by the way). After collecting the materials, you have to go to the Item Shop (Alex's Shop) to craft Kyiat's Bridge before you can deliver it.

### LF Main Quest 3: The Nitana 

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Main Quest Highway:** LF MQ3
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Battle a Nitana
- **Rewards:** Tesven's Amulet, 25 Coins
- **Recommendation:** You've got this! This quest used to be The Rudakai. Imagine battling twice as many words and needing several other resources to get started! But this is very doable.

### LF Main Quest 4: Don't Regift Curses 

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Main Quest Highway:** LF MQ4
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect Tesven's Amulet, 4 Essence, 8 Dust, and 4 Leaves
- **Rewards:** Mama Tree unlocks
- **Recommendation:** Hopefully you have Tesven's Amulet from the previous quest You may well have everything you need already at this point. Essence is the trickiest bit here; at low Luck, your best bet is probably battling Grey's Mawt, which drops at least one Essence and often two; if you're feeling up to a 25-minute sprint, Viyusa just might drop all you need at one go. As your Luck increases, Wignow become more reliable Essence providers and cost fewer words. And if you're trying to remember what Luck is and how it works, double-check the FAQ back at the beginning of the Guide. :)

### MT Main Quest 1: To Great Heights

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Main Quest Highway:** MT MQ1 (after Luciola Forest)
- **Type:** Battle & Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Lorsa and craft 1 Lorsa Nest
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendations:** Lorsa are nice and straightforward. The Lorsa Nest probably won't take long to scrounge for: you'll need 6 Leaves, 2 Claws, 10 Wood, and 5 Rope, which you can get from fighting a Tylu (2-3 Claws and 1 Leaf), 3 Awas (6 Rope and around 5 Leaves and 4 Wood), and 4 Xin (around 7 Wood, plus extra Leaves), which is about 1600 words. Lorsa are also a nice source of Feathers if you want to go back to the LF Safety Hats quest.

### MT Main Quest 2: A Secret Message

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Main Quest Highway:** MT MQ2
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 3 Essence, 5 Feathers, and 8 Dust
- **Rewards:** 1 Steel Dagger
- **Recommendations:** Between Lorsa and Wignow, you should be able to cover this easily even if your previous supplies aren't up to scratch. Remember that Wignow will help with the Watering Hole sidequest, too, if you picked that up. This conflicts with the Shaman's Hideout sidequest in that they have a lot of requirements in common, but still nice to do both.

### MT Main Quest 3: Elder Library

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Main Quest Highway:** MT MQ3
- **Type:** Battle 
- **Requirements:** Defeat the Search Party
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendations:** Search Party appears as a monster in the Wilderness during the span of this quest, and only during the span of this quest. And no, it doesn't drop anything. Just go ahead and power through when you feel up to it.

### MT Main Quest 4: Aid to an Elder

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Main Quest Highway:** MT MQ4
- **Type:** Battle 
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Assassins
- **Rewards:** Suwö as Companion, Three Points Crossing unlocks, Stone of the Forest
- **Recommendations:** Up your Luck before fighting Assassins, and they're more likely to give you Wooden Keys and Steel Daggers. Also, stick around and work on some sidequests after this, because Three Points Crossing can be demanding and it's nice to be stocked up first.

# Side Quests, in Alphabetical Order

### A Battle of Wills - HuntS1

- **Location:** Available in the Luciola Forest 
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via Hunt Trail HuntS1 The Hunt Begins) • **A Battle of Wills** • HuntS2 Battle of Merit • HuntS3 Battle of Constitution • HuntS4 A Battle of Evolution
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Velts
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Velts is meant to be on the challenging side, and this launches her series of challenges roaming all around Oge-Mai. I highly recommend this series, because it's basically fighting Velts once in a bunch of places and getting a lot of bragging rights and some nice swag at the end.

### Biweekly: Monster Hunter

- **Location:** Global
- **Route:** none needed; globally available from the start
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Battle 20 Monsters of any kind
- **Rewards:** 1 Leafsung Key (used starting in the 3rd region; collect all you can when you can)
- Renews approx. 72 hours after delivery

### Blossom with Flowers! (1/2) - FB

Note: if you're trying to progress to the next quest after this, you'll need to unlock Guardian's Lair; info on how to do that is part of the Forest Expedition Trail.

- **Location:** Forward Base
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via Forest Expedition Trail: BC Hard Day's Walk) • FB **Blossom with Flowers! 1/2** • GL Bright Night Blossoms 2/2
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Dandeleon (220 words in 30 min)
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Key
- **Recommendations:** Go for it! It's fun! It's easy! It's on the path to a nice crown!

### Boots Made For Climbing - TT

- **Location:** Tall Trees
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: FB Javelin Toss West
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Buholi, 1 Buhini, and 1 Buhovi; deliver 25 Leaves and 1 Leafsung Boots
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest, 1 Wooden Key, 1 Stempo
- **Recommendations:** Leafsung Boots are awfully valuable things to lose. But this is a pretty nice reward, especially if you don't have any Stempos yet.

### Bridge of Sighs - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** MT MQ4 / Aid To An Elder
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 100 Wood and 50 Rope
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendation:** I'd recommend trying to make sure you still have a supply of 100 Wood and 100 Rope even after being done with this, so I wouldn't pick this up till you have close to 200 Wood and 150 Rope in stock. The rewards aren't worth nearly as much as the cost, but just finishing another quest can be satisfying.

### Bright Night Blossoms (2/2) - GL

Note: technically, this appears as soon as you open Guardian's Lair whether you've completed the previous quest or not. But since you can't pick it up until the other one is completed, I'm counting this as a quest path.

- **Location:** Guardian's Lair
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via Forest Expedition Trail: BC Hard Day's Walk) • FB Blossom with Flowers! 1/2 • **Bright Night Blossoms (2/2)**
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Night Dandeleons (and already have Blossom With Flowers from Forward Base completed)
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Dandeleon Crown
- **Recommendations:** It's a cute crown and they're cute monsters! Who only come out at night. ("Night" apparently starts at 18:00 where I am; I'm not sure how much of that calculates Daylight Savings or not. From others, I suspect it's 19:00 without Daylight Savings.)

### Buholi in the Sky - TT

- **Location:** Tall Trees
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: FB Javelin Toss West
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Buholi
- **Rewards:** 4 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** Notice that the requirements don't mention that you'll need to beat 2-3 Nezthai for every Buholi you want to fight. Pace yourself.

### A Clue to the Past - Hunt S1

- **Location:** Available in the Luciola Forest 
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via Hunt Trail: HuntS1 Joining the Hunt) • **A Clue to the Past** • HuntS1 Elder Library Assistants • HuntS1 Elder Library Security
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Sassi
- **Rewards:** 5 Hunter Tokens & 1 Hunt Map Piece
- **Recommendations:** This is an absolute prerequisite for the Hunt Begins quest. That's almost beside the point for me, because I will be tracking down those Sassis like there's no tomorrow to raid the Token Store of all its goods, and this is a nice side benefit, but yeah: worth prioritizing a bit.

### Collector - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** LF MQ4
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Have 30 Unique Items
- **Rewards:** 8 Core Crystals
- **Recommendation:** Grab immediately. Core Crystals are not to be shunned, and all you have to do is have this sit in your Questbook till you've found enough different Items in your inventory to fill it. (This usually doesn't take long, just following the main course of the game.)

### Cool Creature Highlights (2/3) - MT

Note: NOT POSSIBLE to complete till Dark Forest Outpost unlocked

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via LF MQ 4) • MT Warm Creature Highlights 1/3 • **Cool Creature Highlights 2/3** • MT Creature Colors & Highlights 3/3
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** 
  - Deliver:
    - 10 River Water
    - 25 Ardii Dust
    - 10 Lorsa Fur
    - 3 Xyplos Ink
    - 10 Dark Forest Leaves
  - Defeat:
    - 10 Gobkey
    - 5 Patliadu
    - 5 Xuso
    - 3 Vezi
- **Rewards:** 3 Bones Chests, 1 Bones Key
- **Recommendations:** You got past the first part - congrats! No mean feat. Now you'll get a key for your chests, and the Dark Forest Leaves have to come from the Dust. Good luck with the Xyplos Ink, too (remember Sliv can get it for you more easily than Xyplos if you have enough Luck), and good luck fighting the Vezi and good luck remembering that Gobkeys are way back in the Forest Expedition in Guardian's Lair. Go forth and conquer!

### Creature Colors & Highlights (3/3) - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via LF MQ4) • MT Warm Creature Highlights 1/3 • MT Cool Creature Highlights 2/3 • **Creature Colors & Highlights 3/3**
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** 
  - Deliver:
    - 5 Dandeleon Flower
    - 8 Nuig String
    - 10 Essence
    - 3 Sacred Feathers
    - 3 White Fur
  - Defeat:
    - 3 Suulan
    - 3 Arenica
    - 10 Kaija
    - 10 Scofin
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Pride River Dye Hair https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;836-pride-siren-hair-5634-64111.png
- **Recommendations:** Look at the lovely hair! Isn't it wonderful? I'd rec attacking the monsters first, because the Suulan and Arenica will drop some of what you need. Dandeleon Flowers only come from Dandeleons and Night Dandeleons in the Forest Expedition, though, so you may have to travel for those (get the Kaija and Scofin in Base Camp and Tall Trees respectively). For Nuig String, make sure you've fought all the Castu quests from Balance that you want to fight, because Castu are a great source of Nuig String and they're really popular in Balance quests.

### The Curator of Elder Library - HuntS1

- **Location:** Available in the Luciola Forest 
- **Hunt Trail Route:** (available from game open) • HuntS1 Joining the Hunt • HuntS1 The Hunt Begins • HuntS1 Deeper Forest Hunting • HuntS1 A Past Not Forgotten • **The Curator of Elder Library** • HuntS2 All Who Wander • HuntS2 Oh, Endless Possibilities! • HuntS2 No Wrong Path • Hunt S2 Stumbling Upon Sheep • HuntS3 To Grow & Change • HuntS3 Bettering Ourselves • HuntS3 Bigger & Brighter • HuntS3 A Bubble Dream • HuntS4 Dirt to Dust • HuntS4 Celebrate Joy • HuntS4 Still Missing Something • ???
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4x the Curator of Elder Library
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Sassi Pet https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;featured&#95;sassi&#95;pet.png
- **Recommendations:** HOW. HOW CAN YOU NOT. KITTY! (... and, y'know, unlocking subsequent Seasons of the Hunt. But. KITTY!)

### Curator's Family - HuntS1

- **Location:** Available in the Luciola Forest 
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS1 A Past Not Forgotten
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each: Burocat, Sassi, Clawadin, Alnu
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Look, if you don't just want to battle fierce kitties till the cows come home, I don't understand you. But if that marvelous option doesn't appeal to you, then there's not much need to focus on this quest. Unlike the other assistant quests, this does not advance the game.

### Daily: Monster Hunter

- **Location:** Global
- **Route:** none needed; globally available from the start
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Battle 10 Monsters of any kind
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Key
- Renews approx. 12 hours after delivery

### Daily: Short Story 

- **Location:** Global
- **Route:** none needed; globally available from the start
- **Type:** Wordcount
- **Requirements:** Write 5000 words. (Note: Attack stat will not affect this number; it's 5K regardless.)
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest

### A Darkened Forest - BC

- **Location:** Base Camp
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: MT New Adventurous Horizons
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Min Level 3, 25 Dust, 3 Leaf Boots, 5 Rope
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest and 1 Wooden Key
- **Recommendations:** As you please. Pretty obvious what the costs/benefits are.

### Deeper Forest Hunting - HuntS1

- **Location:** Available in the Luciola Forest 
- **Hunt Trail Route:** (available from game open) • HuntS1 Joining the Hunt • HuntS1 The Hunt Begins • **Deeper Forest Hunting** • HuntS1 A Past Not Forgotten • HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library • HuntS2 All Who Wander • HuntS2 Oh, Endless Possibilities! • HuntS2 No Wrong Path • Hunt S2 Stumbling Upon Sheep • HuntS3 To Grow & Change • HuntS3 Bettering Ourselves • HuntS3 Bigger & Brighter • HuntS3 A Bubble Dream • HuntS4 Dirt to Dust • HuntS4 Celebrate Joy • HuntS4 Still Missing Something • ???
- **Type:** Words, Streak, Level, Collection
- **Requirements:** Write 10K words, add 7 consecutive streak days, minimum level 3, Hunt Map Piece 2
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Full Body Scars https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;featured&#95;full&#95;body&#95;scars.png
- **Recommendations:** Pick this up and let it simmer in the background. Words and streak will more or less take care of themselves. Besides, there's no knowing what might be unlocked next month in this quest sequence! You can get Hunt Map Piece 2 by completing Elder Library Assistants.

### Eat the Leaves? - GL

- **Location:** Guardian's Lair
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: FB North: Homeward Bound
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Maikile & 10 Wignow
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Leaf Necklace https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1010-leaf-necklace-7448-12835.png
- **Recommendations:** As this quest unlocks, I'm a long, long way past my first time in the Forest. And this quest makes me nostalgic for that time. So I'm biased in its favor. Objectively, it's worth as much as you like that Leaf Necklace (and multitasking on Wignow quests, if you have any left).

### Edrie's Informative Lorsa - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** MT MQ1 / To Great Heights
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect/Craft 10 Lorsa Nests
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendation:** Not really my cup of tea, but up to you. Be aware that there are quests identical to this one with different names later on, so it might be worth it to think in terms of "do I want to craft 30 Lorsa Nests or not". 

### Elder Library Assistants - HuntS1

- **Location:** Available in the Luciola Forest 
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via Hunt Trail: HuntS1 Joining the Hunt) • HuntS1 A Clue to the Past • **Elder Library Assistants** • next step: HuntS1 Elder Library's Security
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Alnu
- **Rewards:** Hunt Map Piece 2, 5 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Pick up as soon as you have Forest Expedition open and can get to Alnu wandering around there. Nothing to lose!

### Elder Library's Security - HuntS1

- **Location:** Available in the Luciola Forest 
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via Hunt Trail: Hunt S1 Joining the Hunt) • HuntS1 A Clue to the Past • HuntS1 Elder Library Assistants • **Elder Library's Security**
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Clawadin
- **Rewards:** 5 Hunter Tokens, 1 Hunt Map Piece 3
- **Recommendations:** May the Force be with you against these fierce guardians.

### Fair, Standard, Middling - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** LF MQ4
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 25 Nitana, 25 Castu, 25 Rulo, 25 Illi, and 25 Tylu (all 400-700 word monsters)
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Expedition Tylu Belt
- **Recommendations:** This is a long-term quest that can't be completed until you get halfway through the main quest sequence in the Floating City of Balance, which is a long ways away. These monsters are all over Oge-Mai, not just the Forest Region. If you want to pick up the quest now so that any battles you have against the appropriate creatures count, go ahead; however, this may be worth saving until you run out of other things to do in the entire game, especially since the only reward is essentially bragging rights and a wardrobe item.

### A Family Tree - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** LF MQ4
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Battle 8 Tylu
- **Rewards:** 50 Coins, 1 Wood Spear, 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendation:** Take this one and knock it out! The Wood Spear is a nice weapon to have on hand at this stage.

### Feeding the Lighthouse - FB

- **Location:** Forward Base
- **Forest Expedition Trail Route:** (open via MT MQ4 / Aid To An Elder) • MT New Adventurous Horizons •  BC Hard Day's Walk • **Feeding the Lighthouse** • IN ANY ORDER [FB Javelin Toss West • FB North: Homeward Bound • FB Stone's Throw East]
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 25 Ardia, 25 Ardii, and 25 Ardis
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest, 1 Ardi Lamp
- **Recommendations:** Well, you can't advance until you complete this, anyway. Plus, Ardi* beasts are fun to battle.

### First Steps

see **Lead the Way**

### Forest Creatures - LF

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Unlocked By:** LF MQ 3/The Nitana
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Fight 1 of each monster in Luciola Forest: Puna, Xin, Reenu, Wignow, Awa, Pester, Nitana, Aracni, Aracnu, Rudakai, Mawt, Grey's Mawt

- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: FB Stone's Throw East

- **Rewards:** 3 Stempos

### Hard Day's Walk - BC

- **Location:** Base Camp
- **Forest Expedition Trail Route:** (open via MT MQ4 / Aid To An Elder) • MT New Adventurous Horizons •  **Hard Day's Walk** • FB Feeding the Lighthouse • IN ANY ORDER [FB Javelin Toss West • FB North: Homeward Bound • FB Stone's Throw East]
- **Type:** Battle, Streak
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Kaija, 1 Xuso, and 1 Sacer; have minimum 3-day Streak when you turn in
- **Rewards:** Unlock Forward Base area
- **Recommendations:** Did you not see? Unlock Forward Base. DO IT!

### Huge, Gigantic, Enormous - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** LF MQ4
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 25 Lombri, 25 Rudakai, 25 Vezi, 25 Wetu, and 25 Tambo (all 1100-2000 word monsters)
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Expedition Tambo Belt
- **Recommendations:** This is a long-term quest that can't be completed until you get halfway through the main quest sequence in the Floating City of Balance, which is a long ways away. These monsters are all over Oge-Mai, not just the Forest Region. If you want to pick up the quest now so that any battles you have against the appropriate creatures count, go ahead; however, this may be worth saving until you run out of other things to do in the entire game, especially since the only reward is essentially bragging rights and a wardrobe item.

### The Hunt Begins - HuntS1

- **Location:** Available in the Luciola Forest 
- **Hunt Trail Route:** (available from game open) • HuntS1 Joining the Hunt • **The Hunt Begins** • HuntS1 Deeper Forest Hunting • HuntS1 A Past Not Forgotten • HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library • HuntS2 All Who Wander • HuntS2 Oh, Endless Possibilities! • HuntS2 No Wrong Path • Hunt S2 Stumbling Upon Sheep • HuntS3 To Grow & Change • HuntS3 Bettering Ourselves • HuntS3 Bigger & Brighter • HuntS3 A Bubble Dream • HuntS4 Dirt to Dust • HuntS4 Celebrate Joy • HuntS4 Still Missing Something • ???
- **Type:** Collection, Streak, Words, Level
- **Requirements:**
  - Collect: 1 Hunt Map Piece
  - Streak: 5-day Streak
  - Words: 5000 words
  - Level: Minimum Level 3
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Scarred Eye https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;featured&#95;hunt&#95;scar&#95;eye&#95;left&#95;blue.png
- **Recommendations:** It will take a little while to finish this, and you'll need to complete A Clue To The Past before it's possible to complete this (as it stands when this is being written), but it's worth picking up early so the harder parts have time to accumulate. Note that the Time of Reflection quest also requires a streak, so it doubles well with this.

### Inking By Number (2/5) - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via MT MQ 4/ Aid To An Elder) • MT Tinkering With Leafsung (1/5) • **Inking By Number (2/5)** • MT Inking of Dust (3/5) • MT Thinking of Ink (4/5) • MT Invisible Ink (5/5)
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 15 Reenu Wings, 15 Feathers, 3 Tambo Mane, 10 Claws, and 50 Dust
- **Rewards:** 3 Wooden Keys, unlock Inking of Dust (3/5) (this is the last part of this 5-quest series which can be completed before unlocking the Water Region)
- **Recommendations:** If you're here, you've already finished Tinkering With Leafsung; might as well do the next step! Also gives you something to do.

### Inking of Dust (3/5) - MT

Note: NOT POSSIBLE to complete till Riza Rivertown is unlocked

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via MT MQ 4/ Aid To An Elder) • MT Tinkering With Leafsung (1/5) • MT Inking By Number (2/5) • **Inking of Dust (3/5)** • MT Thinking of Ink (4/5) • MT Invisible Ink (5/5)
- **Type:** Battle, Streak
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Patliadu, 15 Puna, 5 Wetu, and 1 Arenica, and have a minimum 15-day Streak at the time of turning in
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest, unlock Thinking Like Ink (4/5)
- **Recommendations:** This isn't possible to complete till you've made it to Riza Rivertown in the Water Region (one reason I'm not including it in Forest Resources), and again, this is a long-term quest sequence. I would recommend leaving it alone at least until you get to the Floating City of Balance, at which point it *might* be worth combining with other quests to save effort.

### The Invisible Ink (5/5) - MT

Note: NOT POSSIBLE to complete till partway through the Floating City of Balance

Monsters and Resources listed here will not be linked with this quest outside the All Resources section.

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via MT MQ 4/ Aid To An Elder) • MT Tinkering With Leafsung (1/5) • MT Inking By Number (2/5) • MT Inking of Dust (3/5) • MT Thinking of Ink (4/5) • **The Invisible Ink (5/5)**
- **Type:** Collection, Battle, Streak
- **Requirements:** Collect 5 Leafsung Ink and 20 Red Dye, defeat 1 Tambo and 3 Bruja, and have a minimum 30-day Streak when you turn it in
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Leafsung Tattoos (and yes, they're multicolor, but here's the baseline: https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;leafsung&#95;tattoo&#95;yellow.png )
- **Recommendations:** DOOO IIIITTTT. I might have mixed feelings about recommending the whole quest sequence to non-obsessive non-high-output people, but if you're here, you're SO CLOSE to rad tattoos. DOOO IIIITTT.

### Itsy, Bitsy, Teeny - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** LF MQ4
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 25 Reenu, 25 Ardii, 25 Dandeleon, 25 Frizi, and 25 Puna (all 60-220 word monsters)
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Expedition Ardi Belt
- **Recommendations:** This is a long-term quest that can't be completed yet; some of these monsters are rather deep in the Expedition section that you can't unlock till after you finish Mama Tree, and one isn't available till you get to Three Points Crossing (though once you finish Mama Tree these should be pretty available). If you want to pick up the quest now so that any battles you have against the appropriate creatures count, go ahead; just bear in mind you'll be carrying it a while and it might get tricky to keep track of.

### Javelin Toss West - FB

- **Location:** Forward Base
- **Forest Expedition Trail Route:** (open via MT MQ4 / Aid To An Elder) • MT New Adventurous Horizons •  BC Hard Day's Walk • FB Feeding the Lighthouse • IN ANY ORDER [**Javelin Toss West** • FB North: Homeward Bound • FB Stone's Throw East]
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 10 Ardi Lamps
- **Rewards:** Unlock Tall Trees area
- **Recommendations:** If you're trying to beat Tinkering with Leafsung, right beyond this quest is where you get Buhini. But you'll want to have some Nezthai Claws and streak days under your belt before you can get much further than opening this up.

### Joining the Hunt - HuntS1

- **Location:** Available in the Luciola Forest 
- **Hunt Trail Route:** (available from game open) • **Joining the Hunt** • HuntS1 The Hunt Begins • HuntS1 Deeper Forest Hunting • HuntS1 A Past Not Forgotten • HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library • HuntS2 All Who Wander • HuntS2 Oh, Endless Possibilities! • HuntS2 No Wrong Path • Hunt S2 Stumbling Upon Sheep • HuntS3 To Grow & Change • HuntS3 Bettering Ourselves • HuntS3 Bigger & Brighter • HuntS3 A Bubble Dream • HuntS4 Dirt to Dust • HuntS4 Celebrate Joy • HuntS4 Still Missing Something • ???
- **Type:** Wordcount/Level
- **Requirements:** Min Level 3, 3000 Words
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens, unlock the Hunt
- **Recommendations:** This is not optional if you want to participate in the Hunt. Might as well get it done immediately! See what other quests you can do while you're generating 3000 words.

### Just a Mean Green - BC

- **Location:** Base Camp
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: MT New Adventurous Horizons
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 25 Xuso
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Xuso Necklace https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;974-xuso-necklace-7085-57599.png
- **Recommendations:** There seems to be a new theme of a necklace in each Expedition area, and I heartily approve. Xuso drop a lot of good basics, too.

### Keep In Quarantine - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** MT MQ4 / Aid To An Elder
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Villagers
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendation:** The reward itself isn't worth the effort, but the Leaf Boot and Coin stockpile you'll get from fighting Villagers just might be worth it.

### Lead the Way/First Steps - LF

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Unlocked by:** available at game open
- **Type:** Wordcount
- **Requirements:** Write 5000 words. (Note: Attack stat will not affect this number; it's 5K regardless.)
- **Rewards:** 50 Coins
- **Recommendation:** Pick this up as soon as possible. There's never a reason to put off a Wordcount quest, since it will automatically fill while you're doing other things.

### Leafsung Vial Creation - MT

NOTE: This quest is almost impossible to complete until you've completed the quest **Make Attacks Sing**, which is the end of a quest chain in Luciola Forest. However, since it's *unlocked* by opening Mama Tree, I'm counting it thus.

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** LF MQ4
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect/Craft 10 Leafsung Ink
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendation:** Don't bother unless you **really** feel like it. This does not, as far as I can tell, open any other quests, the reward isn't worth the price, and there are many, many other things later you might want to use Leafsung Ink for. They are later in the game, however, so if you're sitting on 9 bottles of Leafsung Ink from the LF quests and just desperately want to craft one more… it's your choice.

### Learn to Fight - LF

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Unlocked by:** available at game open
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Fight 10 of any monster.
- **Rewards:** 50 Coins
- **Recommendation:** Pick this up as soon as possible. It's easy to fill while doing other things.

### Lighting the Way - FB

- **Location:** Forward Base
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: BC Hard Day's Walk
- **Type:** Collection, Battle
- **Requirements:** Deliver 25 Dust and 10 Wood, defeat 5 Ardia
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Key, opening Ardi-beasts in Mama Tree
- **Recommendations:** Up to you. Pretty straightforward!

### Lovely Flower Crown - FB

- **Location:** Forward Base
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: BC Hard Day's Walk
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 15 Dandeleon Flowers & 10 Saliva Vials
- **Rewards:** 3 Wooden Chests & 3 Wooden Keys
- **Recommendations:** I would leave this one for a while personally - Saliva Vials are much more useful to hoard until you've cleaned out Stone City, and Dandeleon Flowers will tend to build up in the background no matter what you're doing. But odds are that by the time you're doing a second pass of the Forest Expedition, this will be an easy win.

### Luciola Lanterns/Night Light - LF

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Unlocked by:** available at game open
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 10 Spider Legs and 10 Dust
- **Rewards:** 5 Leaf Boots
- **Recommendation:** Go ahead and try to knock this out on the early side. The Leaf Boots have a Luck value that will be useful later, and the extra Boots will be very useful by the time you get to the third Main Quest. Aracni are your best bet for the Spider Legs, and Xin are your best source of Dust.

### Luciola Lorsa Nests - LF

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Unlocked by:** MT MQ1/ To Great Heights
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect/Craft 3 Lorsa Nests
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendation:** As you please. Remember you'll have to craft your Lorsa Nests in Mama Tree.

### Luciola Puna - LF

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Unlocked by:** available at game open
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Battle 10 Puna
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendation:** Do as you please! It can be satisfying to find a use for Raw Stone at this time (you'll need it if you're crafting the Wooden Fishing Rods to hunt Puna), and Chests are always nice. But be aware that a later region has a quest that can be fulfilled simultaneously with this one, so if you wait for it for a nice long time, you can double up. (This guide will be more specific when that comes up.)

### Lumberjack's Tools - LF

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Unlocked by:** available at game open
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 5 Wood Hammers, 3 Dust, 5 Fur, 3 Rope
- **Rewards:** 1 Leafsung Sword
- **Recommendation:** This one is very pricey; 5 Wood Hammers don't sound like much until you do the math and realize that that will cost 75 Wood, 15 Rope, and 75 Coins to manufacture.

### Make Attacks Sing - LF

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via LF MQ3/The Nitana) • LF Make Ink Sing • LF Make Words Sing • **Make Attacks Sing** • (ability to craft Leafsung Ink in Mama Tree)
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 30 Essence, 15 Spider Poison, 10 Claws, 10 Dust
- **Rewards:** 5 Leafsung Ink
- **Recommendation:** Got it! After a LOT of resource farming, you have the capacity to make Leafsung Ink. Which is needed to complete several later sidequests in other regions. 

### Make Ink Sing - LF

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via LF MQ3/The Nitana)  • **Make Ink Sing** • LF Make Words Sing • LF Make Attacks Sing • (ability to craft Leafsung Ink in Mama Tree)
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 10 Essence and 10 Spider Poison
- **Rewards:** 1 Leafsung Ink
- **Recommendation:** This actually isn't very useful in and of itself, but it unlocks a very valuable ability eventually, so you might as well get it out of the way early. (Well, very valuable if you're attached to completing sidequests.)

### Make It Work - LF

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Quest Path Route:** available at game open • **Make It Work** • next step LF Style Is Eternal
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 8 Reenu Wings and 5 Feathers
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Key and 25 Coins
- **Recommendation:** Up to you. Do you like fighting Nitana? Are you interested in Keys? Go ahead! (And completing this quest opens the possibility of more Keys from other quests!) Otherwise, there are other possibilities.

### Make Words Sing - LF

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via LF MQ3/The Nitana)  • LF Make Ink Sing • **Make Words Sing** • LF Make Attacks Sing • (ability to craft Leafsung Ink in Mama Tree)
- **Type:** Wordcount & Collection
- **Requirements:** Write 5,000 Words, Collect 20 Essence, 10 Spider Poison, 5 Claws
- **Rewards:** 3 Leafsung Ink
- **Recommendation:** Getting closer! One more quest to unlock the ability to craft Leafsung Ink! And while you're writting 5K words anyway, combine this with another 5K word quest, such as the Daily Short Story quest available in the Global quests.

### Nabia's Exploration - BC

- **Location:** Base Camp
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: MT New Adventurous Horizons
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Sacer, 1 Kaija, 1 Nezthai, 1 Xuso, 1 Ardia, 1 Sapilo, 1 Sapira, 1 Sapiti, 1 Buholi, 1 Buhini, 1 Buhovi, 1 Ardii, 1 Ardis
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Expedition Hat  https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;explorers&#95;hat.png
- **Recommendations:** Absolutely do it. Nothing to lose, pretty pretty quest.

### New Adventurous Horizons - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Forest Expedition Trail Route:** (open via MT MQ4 / Aid To An Elder) • **New Adventurous Horizons** •  BC Hard Day's Walk • FB Feeding the Lighthouse • IN ANY ORDER [FB Javelin Toss West • FB North: Homeward Bound • FB Stone's Throw East]
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Tylu (also be min level 3, but if you're here, you'll be past level 3 anyway)
- **Rewards:** Unlock Base Camp in Expedition
- **Recommendations:** DO IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. Wandering around Expedition is fun, and it's important to know your way around the area if you want to get through the later parts of the main questline. Definitely worth it.

### New Style - LF

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Unlocked by:** available at game open
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 5 Feathers and 10 Fur
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Classic Shorts
- **Recommendation:** Up to you. Wardrobe rewards are only good for dressing up your avatar, but that can be *fun*. Nitana are your best (and in Luciola, only) source of feathers; Awa, Mawt, and Pester are good sources of fur.

### Night Light

see **Luciola Lanterns**

### North: Homeward Bound - FB

- **Location:** Forward Base
- **Forest Expedition Route:** (open via MT MQ4 / Aid To An Elder) • MT New Adventurous Horizons •  BC Hard Day's Walk • FB Feeding the Lighthouse • IN ANY ORDER [FB Javelin Toss West • **North: Homeward Bound** • FB Stone's Throw East]
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 15 Ardi Lamps
- **Rewards:** Unlock Guardian's Lair area
- **Recommendations:** If you want to find Night Dandeleons and their pretty crowns, make sure you stop by here. Plus, completionists need this.

### Nothing But Trouble - SC

- **Location:** Stone City
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: FB Stone's Throw East
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 2 Sapilo, 2 Sapira, and 2 Sapiti, and deliver 6 Vine Nets and 15 Rope
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest & 1 Wooden Key
- **Recommendations:** I mentioned I like Sapi-beasts, right? But at this point in the game, I personally have hundreds of Vine Nets and can spare a few. They might be pricier to you. Bear in mind that the Vine Nets tend to be easiest to get from Mama Tree Wooden Chests.

### One Hundred Creatures - BC

- **Location:** Base Camp
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: MT New Adventurous Horizons
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 100 monsters of any kind
- **Rewards:** 5 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** Always good to have running in the background. It'll fill up without you having to pay any attention, and Stempos are nice to have.

### One of Us - LF

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Unlocked by:** available at game open
- **Type:** Forum
- **Requirements:** Create 1 new thread in the Forum
- **Rewards:** 4 Core Crystals
- **Recommendation:** Go for it and complete it immediately! The Introductions section of the Forum is just for you. 4 Core Crystals don't buy much by themselves, but they're nice to have, and it's nice to introduce yourself to the community. (But no, you won't be able to earn enough Core Crystals for more than one month's subscription by playing, and that one month's worth will be a long time coming. It's probably better to spend on wardrobe.)

### A Past Not Forgotten - HuntS1

- **Location:** Available in the Luciola Forest 
- **Hunt Trail Route:** (available from game open) • HuntS1 Joining the Hunt • HuntS1 The Hunt Begins • HuntS1 Deeper Forest Hunting • **A Past Not Forgotten** • HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library • HuntS2 All Who Wander • HuntS2 Oh, Endless Possibilities! • HuntS2 No Wrong Path • Hunt S2 Stumbling Upon Sheep • HuntS3 To Grow & Change • HuntS3 Bettering Ourselves • HuntS3 Bigger & Brighter • HuntS3 A Bubble Dream • HuntS4 Dirt to Dust • HuntS4 Celebrate Joy • HuntS4 Still Missing Something • ???
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Possess one Hunt Map Piece 3
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Pauldrons https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;armor&#95;pauldrons.png
- **Recommendations:** I'll tell you a secret: this is not a quest. Not really. The requirements are basically "complete the Elder Library's Security quest and don't sell what you get from it". So go do that, and get some cool wardrobe items as a bonus when you're done.

### Protecting the Past - Hunt S1

- **Location:** Available in the Luciola Forest 
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS1 Joining the Hunt
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 10 Rusty Amulets and 10 Rusty Pendants
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** This is a bit on the expensive side - odds are it'll take far fewer battles to get the reward by fighting Sassi than by any other means. Still, if you happen to have a bunch lying around, it's worth considering.

### Proving Your Cunning 4/4 - HuntS1

- **Location:** Available in the Luciola Forest 
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via Hunt Trail HuntS1 Joining the Hunt) • HuntS1 Proving Your Worth 1/4 • HuntS1 Proving your Curiosity 2/4 • HuntS1 Proving Your Perserverance 3/4 • **Proving Your Cunning 4/4** • HuntS1 Proving Your Mettle 5/6 • HuntS1 Proving Your Strength 6/6
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Sapira, 2 Sapilo, and 3 Sapiti
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Don't forget to battle at least one Kaija in Base Camp for each Sapi-beast you intend to battle (Kaija drop the Saliva Vials required to protect from the Sapi-monsters' poison). Then head over to Stone City in Expedition (got to complete our tour) to beat these beasties. Make sure you keep your Luck up, and you could get a Spider Poison per battle here. Nice rewards.

### Proving Your Curiosity 2/4 - HuntS1

- **Location:** Available in the Luciola Forest 
- **Quest Path Route:**  (open via Hunt Trail HuntS1 Joining the Hunt) • HuntS1 Proving Your Worth 1/4 • **Proving your Curiosity 2/4** • HuntS1 Proving Your Perserverance 3/4 • HuntS1 Proving Your Cunning 4/4 • HuntS1 Proving Your Mettle 5/6 • HuntS1 Proving Your Strength 6/6
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 6 Nitana
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** On the off chance that you reach this before you've completed the third Main Quest in Luciola Forest: this combines well with that. Start this after you finish the Kyiat's Bridge quest. If you're further along, this combines well with the Mama Tree Sidequest Fair, Standard, Middling (or, if you just like Nitana, don't worry about this and keep going).

### Proving Your Mettle 5/6 - HuntS1

- **Location:** Available in the Luciola Forest 
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via Hunt Trail HuntS1 Joining the Hunt) • HuntS1 Proving Your Worth 1/4 • HuntS1 Proving your Curiosity 2/4 • HuntS1 Proving Your Perserverance 3/4 • HuntS1 Proving Your Cunning 4/4 • **Proving Your Mettle 5/6** • HuntS1 Proving Your Strength 6/6
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each Lorsa, Illi, Kuay, Tambo
- **Rewards:** 15 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** We've done our Luciola battles and our Forest Expedition battles; now it's time to prove ourselves in Mama Tree. Illi and Tambo are rather popular for sidequests, so maybe see if there are any that interest you before going into this.

### Proving Your Perseverance 3/4 - HuntS1

- **Location:** Available in the Luciola Forest 
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via Hunt Trail HuntS1 Joining the Hunt) • HuntS1 Proving Your Worth 1/4 • HuntS1 Proving your Curiosity 2/4 • **Proving Your Perserverance 3/4** • HuntS1 Proving Your Cunning 4/4 • HuntS1 Proving Your Mettle 5/6 • HuntS1 Proving Your Strength 6/6
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat:
  - 1 Buholi
  - 1 Sacer
  - 3 Kaija
  - 1 Gobkey
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** This might be subtitled "Explore Expedition!" because that's what it is. You'll need to complete Mama Tree before you can pick up the **New Adventurous Horizons** quest to unlock the Forest Expedition, and then you'll need to battle Sacer and Kaija in Base Camp, and then complete Hard Day's Walk to open Forward Base, then fight Nezthai in Forward Base to get the prerequisite 3 Nezthai Claws for Buholi, complete the Feeding the Lighthouse quest in Forward Base to unlock the quests to unlock the other three Forest Expedition areas, beat Javelin Toss West and North: Homeward Bound quests, then fight Buholi in Tall Trees and Gobkey in Guardian's Lair.
  Whew!
  That said, it's worth unlocking Expedition (and the followup quest to this requires unlocking Stone City, so don't skip that quest forever). If you were wondering where Buhini are, that's where. And there are other Mama Tree sidequests that benefit from Expedition being opened.

### Proving Your Strength 6/6 - HuntS1

- **Location:** Available in the Luciola Forest 
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via Hunt Trail HuntS1 Joining the Hunt) • HuntS1 Proving Your Worth 1/4 • HuntS1 Proving your Curiosity 2/4 • HuntS1 Proving Your Perserverance 3/4 • HuntS1 Proving Your Cunning 4/4 • HuntS1 Proving Your Mettle 5/6 • **Proving Your Strength 6/6**
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 6 Tylu
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Small Axe https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;678-small-axe-4213-56837.png
- **Recommendations:** There are bunches of sidequests that require fighting Tylu, so go comb the Mama Tree sidequests to be sure there aren't any you want to double up with (especially A Family Tree, with its almost-equal requirements)

### Proving Your Worth 1/4 - HuntS1

- **Location:** Available in the Luciola Forest 
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via Hunt Trail HuntS1 Joining the Hunt) • **Proving Your Worth 1/4** • HuntS1 Proving your Curiosity 2/4 • HuntS1 Proving Your Perserverance 3/4 • HuntS1 Proving Your Cunning 4/4 • HuntS1 Proving Your Mettle 5/6 • HuntS1 Proving Your Strength 6/6
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat:
  - 3 Reenu
  - 2 Wignow
  - 1 Pester
  - 1 Mawt
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** This is mostly good for bragging rights, although it's pretty satisfying to have done. It dovetails well with the Luciola Forest quest Forest Creatures, and you'll get useful inventory battling these monsters.

### Safety Hats - LF

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Unlocked by:** available at game open
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 20 Feathers
- **Rewards:** 1 Leaf Helmet
- **Recommendation:** Not really worth it. You'll probably get a Leaf Helmet in most Wooden Chest drops, and there's no urgent need to stockpile. If you're a completionist, be aware that saving this one for later means you might be able to complete it instantly, with stockpiles you gather on the way.

### Sand Mountain Caravan - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** MT MQ4 / Aid To An Elder
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Tambo
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest, 1 Wooden Key, 1 Leafsung Boots
- **Recommendation:** Think fighting a Tambo is intense? It is. But the rewards are great. You'll probably get a Wooden Chest for every Tambo you fight, and these are the only Leafsung Boots you'll get in the game without crafting them yourself. Do it if you can.

### Save the Children

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Unlocked by:** available at game open
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 10 Essence and 10 Spider Poison
- **Rewards:** 2 Wooden Keys
- **Recommendation:** Not a priority, unless you're burning to find out what's inside your Wooden Chests. Aracni are still your best source of Spider Poison, and Wignow are your best source of Essence.

### Scouting The Land - SC

- **Location:** Stone City
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: FB Stone's Throw East
- **Type:** Words, Streak, Battle
- **Requirements:** Write 3,000 words, maintain a 3-day streak AFTER picking up quest, defeat 1 Sapilo, 1 Sapira, and 1 Sapiti 
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest
- **Recommendations:** I like the Sapi-beasts because they drop Spider Poison, and the other requirements aren't too irksome. This is a quick quest on the battle side, so why not?

### Scouting the Trees - TT

- **Location:** Tall Trees
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: FB Javelin Toss West
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Buholi, 1 Buhini, and 1 Buhovi; deliver 3 Vine Nets and 12 Rope
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest
- **Recommendations:** If you're doing Boots Made for Climbing, might as well double-dip. Watch the Vine Net and Rope levels, though; they become very important later in the game, and you don't want to wear yourself out getting them.

### A Season for Hope - HuntS1

- **Location:** Available in the Luciola Forest 
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS1 Joining the Hunt
- **Type:** Words
- **Requirements:** Write 2020 words
- **Rewards:** 5 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Pick it up and have it fill itself in the background. Easy-peasy.

### Shadows In Flux - GL

- **Location:** Guardian's Lair
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: FB North: Homeward Bound
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Gobkeys
- **Rewards:** 3 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** TAKE IT. The Stempos are an outstanding reward for 2K words of writing, and you'll want the Gobkey's drops if you ever want to see the Shrine of Ages.

### Shaman's Hideout

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** LF MQ4
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 8 Essence, 3 Claws, 12 Dust
- **Rewards:** 5 Leaf Boots
- **Recommendation:** Why not? Essence are easy to get from Wignow, if you did A Family Tree you'll probably have enough Claws, Dust isn't used for a ton of things, and Leaf Boots are nice to have for battles.

### Sleepless in Stone City - SC

- **Location:** Stone City
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: FB Stone's Throw East
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 8 Sapilo & 8 Oncaiii
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Sapiemon Necklace https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;979-monkey-necklace-7096-75774.png
- **Recommendations:** It's a little pricey, once you factor in the invisible Kaija costs, but it is a lovely necklace and they are fun beasties to battle.

### Slowest Tortoise Wins - SC

- **Location:** Stone City
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: FB Stone's Throw East
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 12 Reudod
- **Rewards:** 2 Wooden Chests & 2 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** A very nice reward, but I admit I'm partial to these tortoises and I like an excuse to fight them.

### Spreading Hope - HuntS1

- **Location:** Available in the Luciola Forest 
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS1 Joining the Hunt
- **Type:** Forum
- **Requirements:** Post 3 Messages in the Forum
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** I mean, I like the Forums quite a lot; I don't see the downside. Post away! If you're still starting out and wanting to avoid the Forums as much as possible, I'd combine this with the One Of Us sidequest in Luciola Forest and Tribe Member sidequest in Mama Tree.

### Stone City Chaos - SC

- **Location:** Stone City
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: FB Stone's Throw East
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 each Sapilo, Sapira, Sapiti, and Reudod
- **Rewards:** 4 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** I hope you're looking for overlap, because this quest overlaps with pretty much every other quest in Stone City. If you haven't gotten far in the Desert yet, the Stempos are irresistibly available here. Look! Ways to pause your streak!

### Stone's Throw East - FB

- **Location:** Forward Base
- **Forest Expedition Trail Route:** (open via MT MQ4 / Aid To An Elder) • MT New Adventurous Horizons •  BC Hard Day's Walk • FB Feeding the Lighthouse • IN ANY ORDER [FB Javelin Toss West • FB North: Homeward Bound • **Stone's Throw East**]
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 10 Ardi Lamps
- **Rewards:** Unlock Stone City area
- **Recommendations:** If you're on a roll, prioritize this one: the region has some quests that are nice to collect early and have in the background while you're opening up.

### Studying Substance Samples - HuntS1

- **Location:** Available in the Luciola Forest 
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS1 Joining the Hunt
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 50 Dust
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** I don't know about you, but I'm always overloaded on Dust. This is an easy YES.

### Sturdy Wooden Fence - FB

- **Location:** Forward Base
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: BC Hard Day's Walk
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 25 Wood and 15 Rope
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendations:** If you've been playing long enough to get this far, you don't need my recommendation. Obvious tradeoffs. I wouldn't do this without having at least 10x the needed amount on hand, personally - the resources are too valuable.

### Style is Eternal

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Quest Path Route:** available at game open • LF Make It Work • **Style Is Eternal**
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 10 Feathers, 15 Reenu Wings, 5 Lorsa Fur
- **Rewards:** 3 Wooden Keys
- **Recommendation:** Are you telling me you don't want those Wooden Keys? But note that you cannot get Lorsa Fur in Luciola Forest; you'll need to go to Mama Tree for that. You can also get Feathers in the same place as Lorsa Fur.

### Swing, Sway, Summon - TT

- **Location:** Tall Trees
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: FB Javelin Toss West
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 25 Feathers
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest, 1 Wooden Key
- **Recommendations:** I would pick this up when you have 25 Feathers to spare. (And by this point, you'll be able to guess when you have 25 Feathers to spare.) I would not put myself out grinding Feathers at this point.

### Thinking Like Ink (4/5) - MT

Note: NOT POSSIBLE till partway through the Floating City of Balance

Monsters and Resources listed here will not be linked with this quest outside the Water Resources and All Resources sections. If you want to know sources for these requirements, see the Water Resources or All Resources.

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via MT MQ 4/ Aid To An Elder) • MT Tinkering With Leafsung (1/5) • MT Inking By Number (2/5) • MT Inking of Dust (3/5) • **Thinking of Ink (4/5)** • MT The Invisible Ink (5/5)
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** 10 Vezi Shells, 15 Nuig String, 100 River Grass, 10 Dí Bags, and 5 Xyplos Ink 
- **Rewards:** 3 Leafsung Keys, unlock The Invisible Ink (5/5)
- **Recommendations:** Make no mistake, as wonderful as Leafsung Keys are, these particular ones aren't worth the ingredients on their own; it's all about working toward the Leafsung Tattoos in the end. And if some of the ingredients look unfamiliar, you're probably not far enough in the Floating City of Balance yet. But if you've gotten this far, it'd be silly not to see the whole thing through!

### Time of Reflection - HuntS1

- **Location:** Available in the Luciola Forest 
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS1 Joining the Hunt
- **Type:** Streak
- **Requirements:** Maintain a 4-day Streak
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** You'll be doing other quests requiring streaks as long or longer; might as well do this at the same time. (Hint: The Hunt Begins is one of those quests.)

### Tinkering With Leafsung (1/5) - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via MT MQ 4/ Aid To An Elder)  • **Tinkering With Leafsung (1/5)** • MT Inking By Number (2/5) • MT Inking of Dust (3/5) • MT Thinking of Ink (4/5) • MT The Invisible Ink (5/5)
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Aracni, 5 Wignow, 5 Lorsa, 5 Mawt, and 5 Buhini
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest, unlock Inking By Number (2/5) (this is a 5-quest series which is actually not possible to complete until all Oge-Mai regions have been unlocked and most of the main quests completed)
- **Recommendations:** Go ahead and get started on this project if you want! The quest series culminates in a lovely Leafsung Ink Tattoo wardrobe item and gives nice little rewards along the way. Your difficulty at this stage will be finding Buhini: they are in the Expedition area, a bonus region. You will need to complete the New Adventure Horizons side quest to unlock the Base Camp in Expedition, and then you will *further* need to complete A Hard Day's Walk in Base Camp to unlock Forward Base in Expedition, and then Feeding the Lighthouse in Forward Base to unlock the ability to craft Ardi Lamps, and then Javelin Toss West to open Stone Trees, which is the home of Buhini. Whew. That was a lot. And that's not even getting into the materials and things you'll need to craft them. TL;DR: Take this at your own pace, no need to rush.

### Tinkering With Trinkets - LF

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Unlocked by:** MT MQ 2/ A Secret Message
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 5 Rusty Amulets and 5 Rusty Pendants
- **Rewards:** 50 Coins
- **Recommendation:** The numbers don't work in the slightest; the materials are easily worth 50 coins, especially now that Rusty Amulets no longer drop as rewards. But if it's satisfying, and/or if you're piling up more Rusty Pendants than you know what to do with, here you go.

- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: BC Hard Day's Walk
- **Type:** Wordcount, Streak

### Warm Creature Highlights (1/3) - MT

Note: NOT POSSIBLE to complete till Oge-Mai Desert fully unlocked

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via LF MQ 4) • **Warm Creature Highlights 1/3** • MT Cool Creature Highlights 2/3 • MT Creature Colors & Highlights 3/3
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** 
  - Deliver:
    - 3 Red Dye
    - 5 Spider Poison
    - 5 Ardi Lamp
    - 10 Feathers
    - 10 Nezthai Claws
  - Defeat:
    - 5 Ripos
    - 3 Desert Rudakai
    - 5 Sapiti
    - 5 Tylu
- **Rewards:** 2 Bones Chests
- **Recommendations:** The quest description aptly warns you: **Advanced Quest - Must have Desert Expedition Areas unlocked to Complete**. The reward is fairly useless until you get to the Dust Region (at which point it's quite nice). So this is a late-game thing in practice, and you absolutely shouldn't bother until far later, when you know what these things are.
  That said, Ardi Lamps and Nezthai Claws are in Forward Base (see Travel Directions if you need help figuring out how to get there; it's in the Forest Expedition), Sapiti are in Stone City (ditto), and Ripos is in the Underground Ruins in the Desert Expedition. And if you can't figure out the rest, you probably haven't gone far enough in the game to worry about it.

### Watering Hole - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** LF MQ4
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 44 Wignow
- **Rewards:** 4 Wooden Keys, 1 Steel Dagger
- **Recommendation:** Those Wignow are good munching, you'll get a valuable stockpile of Leaves and Essence out of it, go ahead and pick it up unless you hate Wignow.

### Weekly: Monster Hunter

- **Location:** Global
- **Route:** none needed; globally available from the start
- **Type:** Battle

### Written Accounts - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** LF MQ4
- **Type:** Words
- **Requirements:** Write 25,000 words
- **Rewards:** 100 Coins, 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendation:** Pick this up immediately and let it fill itself. Especially if you've just come over from finishing Luciola Forest: any words you've written the day you pick up the quest will count. (Downside: your Attack bonus doesn't affect how many words you have to write. It will be 25,000 regardless.)
