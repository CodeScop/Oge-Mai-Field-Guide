LAST UPDATED 5 JUL 2020

It's Camp NaNo time! Welcome to the **Alien Meteoroid Expedition**!

I'll be trying to keep up with this space (although I have times when I'm Very Busy this month, and the wiki may be better at keeping up)

### Global Challenges:

- Write 7.5 Million Words To Build Our Landing Pad: COMPLETE after approx 84 hours

###List of Kirala-Defined Phases For This Event:

- Spaceship Arrives: Jul 4-6: We've built the landing pad! Time to enjoy the fruits of our labor until the Research Lab is ready to start.
- Opening Phase: Jul 1 - 4: event opens up, and we're waiting for the alien landing pad to be built!

## Quick Quests To Pick Up ASAP List:

### Impact Crater

- **Aid the Wordsmith**: A series which depends on wordcount; best to keep up with this as much as possible!
- **One Rocky Start**: All these gotta-catch-'em-all quests are good to pick up immediately and have in the background.

### Mining Site

- **Every Day Battling**: A streak quest which is good to have in the background

### Spaceship

- **An Alien Exam**: Same as One Rocky Start, it's good to have this kind of broad quest in the background, if you have the space. Be aware that Dr Hogglevoss and Ame are not yet with us (should be available after the Research Lab is built; construction starts Monday 6 Jul)
