LAST UPDATED 21 JUL 2020

It's Camp NaNo time! Welcome to the **Alien Meteoroid Expedition**!

I'll be trying to keep up with this space (although I have times when I'm Very Busy this month, and the wiki may be better at keeping up)

### Global Challenges:

- Starting Jul 8: Lab Power Up: 1 Million Words: COMPLETE after approx. 10 hours
- Starting Jul 7: Lab Exterior: 2 Million Words: COMPLETE after approx 20 hours
- Starting Jul 6: Lab Metal Frame: 2 Million Words: COMPLETE after approx 20 hours
- Starting Jul 1: Write 7.5 Million Words To Build Our Landing Pad: COMPLETE after approx 84 hours

###List of Kirala-Defined Phases For This Event:

- Large Experiment: Jul 21-?: I see nothing good coming from mixing Tambo, Kiru, Nuig, and Zanthei. We'll see what happens.
- Preparing For Large Experiment: Jul 20-21: This is going to be very short, and it's mostly a chance to play around with the new quest involving the matchup results.
- Experiment: Sassi v Lubu: Jul 17-20: I find Xomri a little disturbing, but hey. Next experiment is cats and dogs and WHAT'S NEXT, because this is the last Experiment of its kind...
- Experiment: Lombri v Xin: Jul 14-17: Sulanica is AMAZING. Let's see what happens with Lombri and Xin. (ClouDragon has an excellent artist's rendering of a possible result halfway down this page: https://4thewords.com/forum/thread/guessing-the-next-match-up)
- Experiment: Arenica v Suulan: Jul 11-14: Voting by battle again! Mowow is the result of Maesc & Wignow, and now the Arenica Hologram and Suulan Hologram are dropping the same as other holograms
- Experiment: Wignow v Maesc: Jul 8-11: We're voting by battle! There are holograms of the Wignow and Maesc in the Research Lab for us to fight. Drops are identical; the only difference is which you want more of in the hybrid result!
- Spaceship Arrives: Jul 4-8: We've built the landing pad! Two days to enjoy the fruits of our labor, and then a few days to build the Research Lab as a community.
- Opening Phase: Jul 1-4: event opens up, and we're waiting for the alien landing pad to be built!

## Quick Quests To Pick Up ASAP List:

### Impact Crater

- **Aid the Wordsmith**: A series which depends on wordcount; best to keep up with this as much as possible!
- **One Rocky Start**: All these gotta-catch-'em-all quests are good to pick up immediately and have in the background.

### Mining Site

- **Every Day Battling**: A streak quest which is good to have in the background

### Research Lab

- **Projecting Light:** May not be strictly "urgent", and if it's too daunting to finish now, no worries - but we are guaranteed time to finish it, if we don't mind hauling the quest around until we unlock the Meteoroid again, and we are NOT guaranteed that we'll be able to start it later.

### Spaceship

- **An Alien Exam**: Same as One Rocky Start, it's good to have this kind of broad quest in the background.
