LAST UPDATED 12 JUL 2020

It's Camp NaNo time! Welcome to the **Alien Meteoroid Expedition**!

I'll be trying to keep up with this space (although I have times when I'm Very Busy this month, and the wiki may be better at keeping up)

### Global Challenges:

- Starting Jul 8: Lab Power Up: 1 Million Words: COMPLETE after approx. 10 hours
- Starting Jul 7: Lab Exterior: 2 Million Words: COMPLETE after approx 20 hours
- Starting Jul 6: Lab Metal Frame: 2 Million Words: COMPLETE after approx 20 hours
- Starting Jul 1: Write 7.5 Million Words To Build Our Landing Pad: COMPLETE after approx 84 hours

###List of Kirala-Defined Phases For This Event:

- Experiment: Arenica v Suulan: Jul 11-14: Voting by battle again! Mowow is the result of Maesc & Wignow, and now the Arenica Hologram and Suulan Hologram are dropping the same as other holograms
- Experiment: Wignow v Maesc: Jul 8-11: We're voting by battle! There are holograms of the Wignow and Maesc in the Research Lab for us to fight. Drops are identical; the only difference is which you want more of in the hybrid result!
- Spaceship Arrives: Jul 4-8: We've built the landing pad! Two days to enjoy the fruits of our labor, and then a few days to build the Research Lab as a community.
- Opening Phase: Jul 1-4: event opens up, and we're waiting for the alien landing pad to be built!

## Quick Quests To Pick Up ASAP List:

### Impact Crater

- **Aid the Wordsmith**: A series which depends on wordcount; best to keep up with this as much as possible!
- **One Rocky Start**: All these gotta-catch-'em-all quests are good to pick up immediately and have in the background.

### Mining Site

- **Every Day Battling**: A streak quest which is good to have in the background

### Spaceship

- **An Alien Exam**: Same as One Rocky Start, it's good to have this kind of broad quest in the background.
