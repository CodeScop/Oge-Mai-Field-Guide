A lot of these are available from the beginning. If there's an asterisk, it unlocked in the process of going through this region.

## Global Quests

Global Quests appear on a regular basis and can be repeated. There are, at the moment, four. I recommend picking all of them up whenever possible, though the daily quests will be more useful early in the game and the rarer quests will be more useful later in the game.

### Daily: Monster Hunter

- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Battle 10 Monsters of any kind
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Key
- Renews approx. 12 hours after delivery

### Daily: Short Story 

- **Type:** Wordcount
- **Requirements:** Write 5000 words. (Note: Attack stat will not affect this number; it's 5K regardless.)
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest
- Renews approx. 12 hours after delivery

### Biweekly: Monster Hunter

- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Battle 20 Monsters of any kind
- **Rewards:** 1 Leafsung Key (used starting in the 3rd region; collect all you can when you can)
- Renews approx. 72 hours after delivery

### Weekly: Monster Hunter

- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Battle 30 Monsters of any kind
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Key (used starting in the 4th region; collect all you can when you can)
- Renews approx. 150 hours after delivery

## Luciola Forest Quests 

### * Forest Creatures

- **Unlocked By:** Main Quest 3/The Nitana
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Fight 1 of each monster in Luciola Forest: Puna, Xin, Reenu, Wignow, Awa, Pester, Nitana, Aracni, Aracnu, Rudakai, Mawt, Grey's Mawt
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Luciola Shoes
- **Recommendation:** Depends on how much you like wardrobe and battle samplers! Me, I quite like them.

### Lead the Way/First Steps

- **Type:** Wordcount
- **Requirements:** Write 5000 words. (Note: Attack stat will not affect this number; it's 5K regardless.)
- **Rewards:** 50 Coins
- **Recommendation:** Pick this up as soon as possible. There's never a reason to put off a Wordcount quest, since it will automatically fill while you're doing other things.

### Learn to Fight

- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Fight 10 of any monster.
- **Rewards:** 50 Coins
- **Recommendation:** Pick this up as soon as possible. It's easy to fill while doing other things.

### Luciola Lanterns/Night Light

- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 10 Spider Legs and 10 Dust
- **Rewards:** 5 Leaf Boots
- **Recommendation:** Go ahead and try to knock this out on the early side. The Leaf Boots have a Luck value that will be useful later, and the extra Boots will be very useful by the time you get to the third Main Quest. Aracni are your best bet for the Spider Legs, and Xin are your best source of Dust.

### Luciola Puna 

- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Battle 10 Puna
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendation:** Do as you please! It can be satisfying to find a use for Raw Stone at this time (you'll need it if you're crafting the Wooden Fishing Rods to hunt Puna), and Chests are always nice. But be aware that a later region has a quest that can be fulfilled simultaneously with this one, so if you wait for it for a nice long time, you can double up. (This guide will be more specific when that comes up.)

### Lumberjack's Tools 

- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 5 Wood Hammers, 3 Dust, 5 Fur, 3 Rope
- **Rewards:** 1 Leafsung Sword
- **Recommendation:** This one is very pricey; 5 Wood Hammers don't sound like much until you do the math and realize that that will cost 75 Wood, 15 Rope, and 75 Coins to manufacture.

### * Make Ink Sing

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 3: The Nitana
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 10 Essence and 10 Spider Poison
- **Rewards:** 1 Leafsung Ink
- **Recommendation:** This actually isn't very useful in and of itself, but it unlocks a very valuable ability eventually, so you might as well get it out of the way early. (Well, very valuable if you're attached to completing sidequests.)

### * Make Words Sing

- **Unlocked by:** Make Ink Sing
- **Type:** Wordcount & Collection
- **Requirements:** Write 5,000 Words, Collect 20 Essence, 10 Spider Poison, 5 Claws
- **Rewards:** 3 Leafsung Ink
- **Recommendation:** Getting closer! One more quest to unlock the ability to craft Leafsung Ink! And while you're writting 5K words anyway, combine this with another 5K word quest, such as the Daily Short Story quest available in the Global quests.

### * Make Attacks Sing

- **Unlocked by:** Make Words Sing
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 30 Essence, 15 Spider Poison, 10 Claws, 10 Dust
- **Rewards:** 5 Leafsung Ink
- **Recommendation:** Got it! After a LOT of resource farming, you have the capacity to make Leafsung Ink. Which is needed to complete several later sidequests in other regions. 

### Make It Work

- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 8 Reenu Wings and 5 Feathers
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Key and 25 Coins
- **Recommendation:** Up to you. Do you like fighting Nitana? Are you interested in Keys? Go ahead! (And completing this quest opens the possibility of more Keys from other quests!) Otherwise, there are other possibilities.

### * Style is Eternal

- **Unlocked by:** Make It Work
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 10 Feathers, 15 Reenu Wings, 5 Lorsa Fur
- **Rewards:** 3 Wooden Keys
- **Recommendation:** Are you telling me you don't want those Wooden Keys? But note that you cannot get Lorsa Fur in Luciola Forest; you'll need to go to Mama Tree for that. You can also get Feathers in the same place as Lorsa Fur.

### New Style

- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 5 Feathers and 10 Fur
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Classic Shorts
- **Recommendation:** Up to you. Wardrobe rewards are only good for dressing up your avatar, but that can be *fun*. Nitana are your best (and in Luciola, only) source of feathers; Awa, Mawt, and Pester are good sources of fur.

### One of Us

- **Type:** Forum
- **Requirements:** Create 1 new thread in the Forum
- **Rewards:** 4 Core Crystals
- **Recommendation:** Go for it and complete it immediately! The Introductions section of the Forum is just for you. 4 Core Crystals don't buy much by themselves, but they're nice to have, and it's nice to introduce yourself to the community. (But no, you won't be able to earn enough Core Crystals for more than one month's subscription by playing, and that one month's worth will be a long time coming. It's probably better to spend on wardrobe.)

### Safety Hats 

- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 20 Feathers
- **Rewards:** 1 Leaf Helmet
- **Recommendation:** Not really worth it. You'll probably get a Leaf Helmet in most Wooden Chest drops, and there's no urgent need to stockpile. If you're a completionist, be aware that saving this one for later means you might be able to complete it instantly, with stockpiles you gather on the way.

### Save the Children

- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 10 Essence and 10 Spider Poison
- **Rewards:** 2 Wooden Keys
- **Recommendation:** Not a priority, unless you're burning to find out what's inside your Wooden Chests. Aracni are still your best source of Spider Poison, and Wignow are your best source of Essence.
