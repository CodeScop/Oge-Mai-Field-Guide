LAST UPDATED 25 SEPT 2020

I was of two minds opening this section, given that the Dust summary is similar to the All Game - but then I decided that narrowing this down to "resources available in the Dust Region without traveling" might be a useful thing. And of course "resources NOT available in the Dust Region, but you'll need them, and here's where you might have forgotten them".

And now there's more to the Dust than Dark Forest Outpost alone!

NOTE: I am counting EVERYTHING from the Hunt Season 4 as part of Dust, to help bring it to your attention if you'd miss it otherwise.

**Oge-Mai Forest, Expedition Forest**

FOREST

- GL = Guardian's Lair (one Hunt monster there)

**Oge-Mai Desert, Expedition Alien Meteoroid, Expedition Desert**

DESERT

**Oge-Mai Water, Expedition Raina**

WATER

- Riza = Riza Rivertown (one Hunt monster there)

**Hunt for the Ancients**

- HuntS1 = Hunt for the Ancients Season 1
- HuntS2 = Hunt for the Ancients Season 2
- HuntS3 = Hunt for the Ancients Season 3
- HuntS4 = Hunt for the Ancients Season 4

**Oge-Mai Dust**
