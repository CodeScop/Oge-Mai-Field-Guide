## Main Quests

### Main Quest 1: Luciola Forest Caretaker

- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Fight 4 Wignows (total: 1000 battle words)
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendation:** Go ahead and polish this off, then go play around! There's a lot of fun exploring to do. Monsters, sidequests... Don't forget to return to your Questbook (or the Current tab in your Lore book) to deliver the quest when you're done!

### Main Quest 2: Building, Not Burning

- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect materials for Kyiat's Bridge - 2 Rope, 2 Spider Legs, 6 Wood
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendation:** This one can be a little tricky, because it's not enough to collect the materials (Rope is easiest to find with Awa, Spider Legs with Aracni, and Wood with Xin, by the way). After collecting the materials, you have to go to the Item Shop (Alex's Shop) to craft Kyiat's Bridge before you can deliver it.

### Main Quest 3: The Nitana 

- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Battle a Nitana
- **Rewards:** Tesven's Amulet, 25 Coins
- **Recommendation:** You've got this! This quest used to be The Rudakai. Imagine battling twice as many words and needing several other resources to get started! But this is very doable.

### Main Quest 4: Don't Regift Curses 

- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect Tesven's Amulet, 4 Essence, 8 Dust, and 4 Leaves
- **Rewards:** Mama Tree unlocks
- **Recommendation:** Hopefully you have Tesven's Amulet from the previous quest You may well have everything you need already at this point. Essence is the trickiest bit here; at low Luck, your best bet is probably battling Grey's Mawt, which drops at least one Essence and often two; if you're feeling up to a 25-minute sprint, Viyusa just might drop all you need at one go. As your Luck increases, Wignow become more reliable Essence providers and cost fewer words. And if you're trying to remember what Luck is and how it works, double-check the FAQ back at the beginning of the Guide. :)
