LAST UPDATED 10 FEB 2021

So, all the quests for the Desert Region. I'm omitting any Main Quests outside the Desert, and for non-Desert Quests I'm listing only the name and location. Let's have a quick recap of how this works:

**The Main Quest Highway** is the main questline of the game, the backbone which unlocks everything else. This line, and only this line, will be defined solely by where it is in the sequence; the Route will tell you where it is in that sequence (LF MQ 3 for the third Main Quest in the Luciola Forest sequence, etc)

**The Expedition Trails** branch off of this Main Quest Highway (so does the **Hunt Trail**) at defined locations. The Route will tell you where it branches off the Main Quest Highway (i.e. which Main Quest unlocks the sidequest that unlocks the Expedition/Hunt) and list out all quests on that Trail. So the quest Joining the Hunt, located in Luciola Forest on the Hunt Trail would read "Hunt Trail Route: (available from game open) • **HuntS1 Joining the Hunt** • HuntS1 The Hunt Begins" etc.

**Quest Paths** are basically a questline off to the side, which don't lead anywhere in particular. To save myself space, they'll be allowed to jump off of Expedition Trails as well as Main Quests. So the quest Battle of Merit, which is unlocked by a quest which is unlocked by The Hunt Begins, would look thus: "Quest Path Route: (open via Hunt Trail HuntS1 The Hunt Begins) • HuntS1 A Battle of Wills • **HuntS1 Battle of Merit** • HuntS1 Battle of Constitution • HuntS1 A Battle of Evolution"

**Lone Quests** are quests which are unlocked by something on the Main Quest Highway or a Trail; instead of a Route, these will simply have an "Unlocked by" field.

#Main Quests, in Order of Unlocking

###(Luciola Forest and Mama Tree quests)

### 3PC Main Quest 1: Earthquakes

- **Location:** Three Points Crossing
- **Main Quest Highway:** 3PC MQ1
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Yasri, 3 Kiru, 1 Lombri, and 1 Bruja
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest
- **Recommendations:** You'll need a Wood Spear to spend on the Lombri battle; they come relatively cheap if you head back to Mama Tree and open a Wooden Chest. (And it's never too early to start collecting Vine Nets from those chests if you want to complete all sidequests in the game.) Take your time with these, explore, and consider which sidequests you value. 3PC is much more intense, generally, than prior regions. Also, most of the quests are collection-oriented. It never hurts to stock up on textiles, Xin/Awa drops, and steel. ALSO: Do NOT use or sell any Raw Fabric, Fine Fabric, or Red Dye received in drops during this quest until you finish Main Quest 3.

### 3PC Main Quest 2: Just Another Brick

- **Location:** Three Points Crossing
- **Main Quest Highway:** 3PC MQ2
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 8 Stone, 30 Wood, 4 Steel, and 10 Rope
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest
- **Recommendations:** Shouldn't take too long, especially if you notice that Rulo drop full-fledged Stone Blocks without you needing to craft them. If, like me, you tend to run low on Wood, remember that it's always better to grind Xin or head to the Forest before you seek other options. 

### 3PC Main Quest 3: Camouflage

- **Location:** Three Points Crossing
- **Main Quest Highway:** 3PC MQ3
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Get 6 Fine Fabric, 10 Raw Fabric, and 4 Red Dye
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Desert Facemask
- **Recommendations:** I hope you saved your drops from the first quest, because if you did, you probably have at least most of what you need already. Otherwise, I recommend fighting Yasri; they're a source of all the materials you need, and 6 Yasri battles should cover all your bases. You could also fight Bruja for Red Dye, Frizi for Raw Fabric, and Desert Wignow for Essence to get all you need to craft Fine Fabric instead, but that's far more time-consuming; I'd only do that if 900-word Bruja are THAT MUCH more appealing than 1250-word Yasri.

### 3PC Main Quest 4: A Desert Army

- **Location:** Three Points Crossing
- **Main Quest Highway:** 3PC MQ4
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Fight 5 Assassins
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest
- **Recommendations:** They're Assassins. Exactly the same as Mama Tree. (In fact, if you went back to Mama Tree and fought Assassins there, it would count the same.) Assassins will disappear from Three Points Crossing once you deliver this quest, so if (like me) you like milking Assassins for Wooden Keys, it might be worth fighting a few extra while they're around before delivering the quest. (Also, the Steel Daggers they drop will be useful in the next region; you'll probably want at least a dozen.)

### 3PC Main Quest 5: A Way South

- **Location:** Three Points Crossing
- **Main Quest Highway:** 3PC MQ5
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Get 20 Wood, 10 Rope, 20 Leaves, 5 Raw Fabric, 1000 Coins, Min Level 10
- **Rewards:** Gansu Watering Hole & Azadi as Companion
- **Recommendations:** Most of these materials are simple: "fight Xin and Awa". And while you're fighting Xin, sell River Grass like there's no tomorrow. (We're approaching the time when you'll need River Grass, same as you've discovered uses for Raw Fabric, but it's still pretty safe to sell down to zero.) This is a good time to skim through the various sidequests and figure out what else you might want to collect at the same time. 

### Gansu Main Quest 1: Circle of Protection

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Main Quest Highway:** Gansu MQ1
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Wetu and 2 Rulo, and collect 15 Desert Stones
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest
- **Recommendations:** It won't hurt to collect a whole lot more Desert Stones than that. Desert Wignow will be your best source if you don't already have enough on hand.

### Gansu Main Quest 2: Lorsa Nest Network

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Main Quest Highway:** Gansu MQ2
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect/Craft 1 Lorsa Nest
- **Rewards:** 100 Coins
- **Recommendations:** Good news! This is the last time you'll be required to build a Lorsa Nest in the game (though there are some sidequests that require it). Bad news: if you don't already have enough Claws to build this, you'll have to head back to the Forest to get them. Make sure you're stocked up on Reenu Wings while you're there; you'll be needing half a dozen later.

### Gansu Main Quest 3: Sacred Shrine

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Main Quest Highway:** Gansu MQ3
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Get 10 Stone Blocks, 5 Sandstone Blocks, 5 Desert Stone, 1 White Fur, and 1 Sacred Feather
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest
- **Recommendations:** Now we're cooking! Suulan and Arenica are now available to fight. If you're low on Steel Daggers to fight them, consider going back to the Forest and fighting Assassins for them, though they're always available in the 3PC Item Bazaar also. You'll probably be spending some time there crafting Sandstone Blocks, too. This is a good time to get a lot of side quests done and dally a bit.

### Gansu Main Quest 4: The Welcoming Committee

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Main Quest Highway:** Gansu MQ4
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Lombri, 2 Yasri, 2 Kiru, and 2 Bruja
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest
- **Recommendations:** With all these Stone Chests, I hope you've been doing the Weekly Global Quests for Stone Keys! You know the routine by now.

### Gansu Main Quest 5: White Stars' Light

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Main Quest Highway:** Gansu MQ5
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 3 White Fur
- **Rewards:** 100 Coins
- **Recommendations:** Obviously this will be Suulan battles, probably two of them. Do as you will.

### Gansu Main Quest 6: Waters of History

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Main Quest Highway:** Gansu MQ6
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Kiru and 3 Bruja
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest
- **Recommendations:** This is the last quest before the two-part finale (wow, who knew there could be so many Main Quests, right?) Good time to take stock and consider how many sidequests you'd like to cross off now.

### Gansu Main Quest 7: Red Witch of the Southern Coven

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Main Quest Highway:** Gansu MQ7
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat the Red Witch (4000 words in 1000 minutes)
- **Rewards:** 1 Stempo
- **Recommendations:** You'll need a Stempo for the next quest, so don't lose or sell this one if it's your only one. Also: when you get to the next quest, READ MY RECOMMENDATION BEFORE COMPLETING.

### Gansu Main Quest 8: Dust to Dust

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Main Quest Highway:** Gansu MQ8
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat the Dust Witch (1 Stempo and 1200 words in 400 minutes)
- **Rewards:** Open Riza Rivertown, Stone of Air
- **Recommendations:** DO NOT DELIVER THIS QUEST… until you've fought the Dust Witch as many times as you can.
  Because the Dust Witch will only stick around as long as this quest is in play. And 1200 words in 400 minutes (three words per minute! c'mon!) will give you *three* Stempos in return for the one you paid, on top of a Golden Chest AND a Stone Chest. (Stone Chests get incredibly rare incredibly soon. Don't waste the opportunity.) Sure, you won't be able to open them until you get the Stone Keys one slow week at a time (although there are more Stone Key quests ahead), but it's worth the investment. Plus, those Protective Mantles you can sell for cash at the time being.

  - Zals
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Lab Coat https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;904-lab-coat-6386-88941.png
- **Recommendations:** Pick up as soon as you have space. If you're planning on fighting any of these anyway, it's nice to have it doubled up.

### All Dressed Up - ShrineMar

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Marionette Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Osemar

- **Type:** Wordcount, Collection
- **Requirements:** Write 4K words and collect Hunt Map Piece 4

### Battle Experience - Gansu

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Unlocked by:** 3PC MQ5/A Way South
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Win 100 Battles Against Any Monster
- **Rewards:** 1 Protective Cloak & 2 Protective Mantles

### Battle of Merit - HuntS2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via Hunt Trail HuntS1 The Hunt Begins) • HuntS1 A Battle of Wills • **Battle of Merit** • HuntS3 Battle of Constitution • HuntS4 A Battle of Evolution
- **Type:** Battle

- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** This is the only S2 quest that requires an S1 quest other than Curator of Elder Library (and the only S2 quest that can be completed without completing S1, for that matter). Make sure you're fighting the 3PC version of Velts if you want to tackle this. She's tougher than the Mama Tree version, but doable enough.

### Battle of Constitution (3/4) - HuntS1

- **Quest Path Route:** (open via Hunt Trail HuntS1 The Hunt Begins) • HuntS1 A Battle of Wills • HuntS1 Battle of Merit • **Battle of Constitution** • HuntS1 A Battle of Evolution

- **Recommendations:** Slightly tedious, but it only takes 5K words to beat. You can do it!

### Birb's the Word - ShrineBird

  - Gayol

  - Peq
  - Ralbone
  - Katock
- **Rewards:** 25 Shrine Stones

  - Giant Dust Spirit
  - Untu Golem
  - Piachi
  - Guardian

- **Recommendations:** Pace yourself. The Untu Golem will be the most challenging if you write onsite - 12 minutes is not much time to write 500 words. The Caravan will be the most endurance-demanding for lower-output writers, although if you have a sufficiently high Defense (like, anything over 16) you'll have 4 days to write 5K words, and if you can scrape >+44 Defense it'll be 5 days.

### A Darkened Forest - BC

- **Location:** Base Camp
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: MT New Adventurous Horizons

### Dazzling Desert Colors - DigS

- **Location:** Dig Site
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Gansu Digging Into Desert Sands
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Zera, 1 Suulan, and 1 Arenica
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Zera Fur Necklace https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1123-zera-fur-necklace-8039-94110.png
- **Recommendations:** I find that necklace pretty irresistible, but YMMV. I also have a weakness for battling the pretty creatures.

### Dazzling Desert Diversity - HuntS2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat:
  - 3 Loi
  - 2 Sakish
  - 2 Zera
  - 1 Kapir
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** The Strengthening quest chain involves Kapir in Part 5, so if you're planning on doing both, try to overlap those. There's no rush on this quest; you can take it at whatever pace you please.

### Deeper Forest Hunting - HuntS1

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Hunt Trail Route:** (unlocked via LF MQ4/Don't Regift Curses) • MT The Winding Path to Elder Library • HuntS1 Joining the Hunt • HuntS1 The Hunt Begins • **Deeper Forest Hunting** • HuntS1 A Past Not Forgotten • HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library • HuntS2 All Who Wander • HuntS2 Oh, Endless Possibilities! • HuntS2 No Wrong Path • Hunt S2 Stumbling Upon Sheep • HuntS3 To Grow & Change • HuntS3 Bettering Ourselves • HuntS3 Bigger & Brighter • HuntS3 A Bubble Dream • HuntS4 Dirt to Dust • HuntS4 Celebrate Joy • HuntS4 Still Missing Something • HuntS4 Proving Your Friendship

### A Desert Exploration - DigS

- **Location:** Dig Site
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Gansu Digging Into Desert Sands
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Kapir
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Tiny Boots
- **Recommendations:** You're going to want to have fought one Kapir sooner or later; why not five? And such stylish boots!

### Desert Rudakai - Gansu

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Unlocked by:** 3PC MQ5/A Way South
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 15 Desert Rudakai
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest & 1 Stone Key
- **Recommendations:** This is a no-brainer YES for me, bc Desert Rudakai are some of my favorites. More objectively, there is a sidequest at the end of the game that also involves 3 Desert Rudakai and it might be nice to postpone this if this involves more Desert Rudakai than you like. Still, it's a good cost/benefit ratio even now, if you have decent stocks of Leaf Boots and Leaves on hand. (I'm fighting a Desert Rudakai writing this. <3 )

### Digging Into Desert Sands - Gansu

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Desert Expedition Trail:** (open via Gansu MQ8/Dust to Dust) • **Digging Into Desert Sands** • DigS Question to Axe • IN ANY ORDER: [ Ruins Searching South • Ruins Navigating North • Ruins Withdrawing West • Ruins Excavating East ] • Ruins Tunnel Locked On• (access to Shrine of Ages)

### A Distant Figure - HuntS2

- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Lubu
- **Rewards:** Hunt Map Piece 6, 5 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** You know the drill by now. Defeat the Ancient's assistant, get the Hunt Map Piece. Don't forget to pick up and turn in No Wrong Path after you're done with this.

### Double the Rarity - 3PC

- **Location:** Three Points Crossing
- **Unlocked by:** Gansu MQ8/Dust to Dust
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Get 12 Sacred Feathers and 12 White Fur
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest
- **Recommendations:** Only if you really want to. This almost is more of a "Battle" quest, because the only way to get Sacred Feathers is by battling Arenica, and Suulan is the only source of White Fur till after the Water Region. And unless your Luck is low, you'll get 12 Golden Chests dropped during these battles apart from the quest rewards. The Sacred Feathers and White Fur are more useful to craft Stempos, but hey, mileage varies.

### Drilling Too Deep - MSite

- **Location:** Mining Site
- **Unlocked by:** Alien Expedition Trail: SpaceS Technology & Dinti
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Arren & 2 Deepo
- **Rewards:** 3 Stempos & Wardrobe: Miner Hat https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;miner&#95;helmet&#95;light&#95;off.png
- **Recommendations:** There are a lot of quests here that need no extra recommendations, so here's a boilerplate to say this is one of them. :)

### Eat the Leaves? - GL

- **Location:** Guardian's Lair
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: FB North: Homeward Bound

### Edrie's Informative Lorsa - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** MT MQ1 / To Great Heights

### Elder Library Assistants - HuntS1

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via Hunt Trail: HuntS1 Joining the Hunt) • HuntS1 A Clue to the Past • **Elder Library Assistants** • next step: HuntS1 Elder Library's Security

### Elder Library's Security - HuntS1

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via Hunt Trail: Hunt S1 Joining the Hunt) • HuntS1 A Clue to the Past • HuntS1 Elder Library Assistants • **Elder Library's Security** 

### Encourage an Ecosystem (4/4) - RLab

- **Location:** Research Lab
- **Quest Path:** (open via Alien Expedition Trail: SpaceS Orders to Repair) • RLab Set Creatures Free! (1/4) • RLab Create a Clearing (2/4) • RLab Build a Biodome (3/4) • **Encourage an Ecosystem (4/4)** • IN ANY ORDER  [RLab Making Mellow Mowow  (*unlocks Mowow in Wilderness*)• RLab Sagacious Sincere Sabu (*unlocks Sabu in Wilderness*) • RLab Silkly Sleek Sulanica (*unlocks Sulanica in Wilderness*)• RLab Zappy Zazzy Xombri (*unlocks Xombri in Wilderness*)• RLab Zooty Zanutaki Zings (*unlocks Zanutaki in Wilderness*)]
- **Type:** Collection, Streak
- **Requirements:** 15-day Streak, and deliver: 
  - 5 Lorsa Fur - found in Mama Tree
  - 15 Raw Fabric
  - 10 Rope
  - 20 River Grass
  - 10 Wood
  - 15 River Water - Water Region, especially Raina Expedition
  - 30 Leaves
  - 3 Vezi Shell - Floating City of Balance, midway through Main Quests
  - 5 Ardii Dust - easiest to find in Forward Base
  - 5 Dinti
  - 5 Saliva Vials - Base Camp
  - 5 Feathers - easiest to find in the Forest Region
- **Rewards:** none listed; unlocking quests to unlock experimental monsters (and 1 Coin, per experimental results)
- **Recommendations:** That is a long shopping list. I hope you can find Dinti without my labeling it (you're IN the Alien Meteoroid Expedition after all), and many of the items are very common, but I've added locations to find the more obscure resources.

### Enter Pan's Labyrinth - LF

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Unlocked by:** 3PC MQ5/A Way South
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Get 20 Wood Hammers, 10 Rope, 3 Steel Bars
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest & 1 Wooden Key
- **Recommendations:** Great way to use extra Xin and Awa materials if you like Xin and Awa. (I don't, so for me Wood Hammers are waaaayyy too expensive to make this quest worth the grind.) Save for when you're between more compelling quests.

### Every Tunnel Connects - Ruins

- **Location:** Underground Ruins
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: DigS Question to Axe
- **Type:** Streak
- **Requirements:** Get a 10-day Streak
- **Rewards:** 4 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** I'm getting this for the easy Stempos. And the suspicion that this might unlock something else later...

### Excavating East - Ruins

- **Location:** Underground Ruins
- **Desert Expedition Trail:** (open via Gansu MQ8/Dust to Dust) • Gansu Digging Into Desert Sands • DigS Question to Axe • IN ANY ORDER: [ Ruins Searching South • Ruins Navigating North • Ruins Withdrawing West • **Excavating East**] • Ruins Tunnel Locked On • (access to Shrine of Ages)
- **Type:** Words, Battle
- **Requirements:** Write 450 words, defeat 1 Gordi
- **Rewards:** 5 Raw Stone
- **Recommendations:** Do it! Make sure you have the other directional quests at the same time, so you're not duplicating effort on wordcount.

### Explore the City - 3PC

- **Location:** Three Points Crossing
- **Unlocked by:** MT MQ4
- **Type:** Streak
- **Requirements:** Maintain a 5 day Streak, starting with the day you pick up the quest
- **Rewards:** 1 Gold Bar & 1 Glass Bar
- **Recommendations:** Go ahead and pick it up immediately! Nothing to lose, a Gold Bar and Glass Bar to gain. This is currently the only Streak quest in the game, too.

### Fair, Standard, Middling - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** LF MQ4

### A Family Tree - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** LF MQ4

### Fan the Flames - 3PC

- **Location:** Three Points Crossing
- **Unlocked by:** MT MQ4
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 100 Wood and 50 Leaves
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest and 3 Leafsung Keys
- **Recommendations:** Leafsung Keys are really, really valuable; apart from the Bi-weekly Monster Hunter quests, there aren't many in the game. If you like Xin and Awa, this is a cinch for something to Do Immediately. If not, it's still something to prioritize, but DO NOT PURCHASE WOOD OR LEAVES FOR THIS. Grind them all you want, but 3PC's main quests require over 1000 Coins; it's unlikely that you can spare any.

### Feathers & Fur - Ruins

- **Location:** Underground Ruins
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: DigS Question to Axe
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Bevrex and 5 Rif
- **Rewards:** 3 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** Did you wait on the Birbs of a Feather and Bounding Over Dunes in Dig Site? Because if you have this in you Questbook, it'll automatically finish while you do the other two. If not, it's still a fairly easy way to get 3 Stempos.

### Feeding the Lighthouse - FB

- **Location:** Forward Base
- **Forest Expedition Trail Route:** (open via MT MQ4 / Aid To An Elder) • MT New Adventurous Horizons •  BC Hard Day's Walk • **Feeding the Lighthouse** • IN ANY ORDER [FB Javelin Toss West • FB North: Homeward Bound • FB Stone's Throw East]

### Fighters, Friends, Foes - ShrineCar

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Carnival Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 2 Fetezira
- **Rewards:** 20 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** None needed! Pretty straightforward.

### First Stempo - Gansu

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Quest Path:** (open via Gansu MQ8) • Gansu Rebuild the Watering Hole • Gansu Respark the Flame • Gansu Local Shrine • **First Stempo** • (ability to craft Stempos), MT Study Break Time
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 10 Essence, 1 Glass, 1 Gold, 1 Sacred Feather, 1 White Fur
- **Rewards:** 1 Stempo, and ability to craft them
- **Recommendations:** This is actually exactly what it says on the tin: the first Stempo you craft. These ingredients will reliably get you one Stempo every time after this, when it becomes a craftable item in Crafts & Trinkets/Wynfri of Water. So you can actually postpone this quest till you want more Stempos, if you want, but the sooner you get it out of the way, the sooner you can craft them in batches.

### First Steps

### Fool Me Once - ShrineFools

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages

  - Fools' Mawt
  - Fools' Mawt (Halloween)
  - Fools' Wignow
  - Fools' Wignow (Halloween)
- **Rewards:** 50 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** This is the one to take up first. If you want to know which are the "Halloween" monsters, they're the ones that aren't simply blue.

### Forest Creatures - LF

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Unlocked By:** LF MQ 3/The Nitana

### A Forest Riddle - SC

- **Location:** Stone City
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: FB Stone's Throw East

- **Location:** Dig Site
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Gansu Digging Into Desert Sands
- **Type:** Streak, Collection
- **Requirements:** Maintain a 3-day streak AFTER picking up the quest, deliver 15 Rope
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Key
- **Recommendations:** A Stone Key for some Rope and time? Hot diggity! Especially if you just got a Stone Chest fighting Kapir.

### Full of Surprises! - Ruins

- **Location:** Underground Ruins
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: DigS Question to Axe
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Ripos
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest & 1 Stone Key
- **Recommendations:** I'm just not into turning down those Stone Chests and Stone Keys. And Ripos *are* a source of valuable Spider Poison and Desert Stones, even if not the best source.

### Gansu Watering Hole Puffs - Gansu

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Quest Path:** (open via 3PC MQ5/A Way South) • Gansu: Watering Hole Puna • **Gansu Watering Hole Puffs** 
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Furoxi
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest
- **Recommendations:** DOOO IIIIIITTTT. Such great rewards for so little (relative) work!

### Gather Lucky Stars - ShrineCO

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Colorful Ooze Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Sothai
- **Rewards:** 15 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** I have a weakness for Sothai purely because the original event had a pretty wardrobe reward attached to Sothai battles. But objectively, this is... another quest! Decide what you want to do with it!

### Gordi & Griffe Gather - Ruins

- **Location:** Underground Ruins
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: DigS Question to Axe
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 25 Gordi & 5 Griffe
- **Rewards:** 5 Stone Blocks, 5 Sandstone Blocks, 3 Raw Gold
- **Recommendations:** I have a sneaking suspicion those rewards will look a lot more generous when we have houses. Meanwhile, it's up to you if it's worth it!

### Green Be Gone! - ShrineCO

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Colorful Ooze Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each:
  - Afeppti
  - Crilum
  - Eguley
  - Elobre
  - Fraite
  - Kenkom
  - Lekhop
  - Otpar
  - Roaki
  - Sothai
  - Spodo
  - Zainga
- **Rewards:** 50 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** Obviously you pick this up immediately so that you can double up any other quests. It's not quite as intimidating as it looks: there might be a dozen monsters, but they're mostly quite tiny.

### Green Ooze Invasion - ShrineGO

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Green Ooze Shrine Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each:
  - Mini Ooze
  - Tryi Ooze
  - Wowtri Ooze
  - Balli Ooze
  - Froji Ooze
  - Whaly Ooze
  - Yawni Ooze
  - Wavi Ooze
  - Giant Ooze
  - Giant Ooze House
- **Rewards:** 50 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** Look at all these entries for your bestiary! Look at all the Shrine Stones! You've got this!

### Guard Your Feet - 3PC

NOTE: This quest isn't possible to complete until you reach Riza Rivertown. 

- **Location:** Three Points Crossing
- **Quest Path:** (open via 3PC Main Quest 5/A Way South) • 3PC Lighten the Load • **Guard Your Feet** 
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Get 10 Steel Boots and 10 Steel Axes
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest
- **Recommendations:** Did you have a lot of fun with Lighten the Load? Totally your cup of tea? Great! You get to do a lot of the same thing again. Because to make 10 Steel Boots (and at least 9 of them *will* need to be crafted, probably all 10), you'll need the same 30 vials of Leafsung Ink you needed last time (you're getting so good at this!) because you need 10 Fabric Boots to create 10 Steel Boots, and you need 30 Leafsung Boots to create 10 Fabric Boots. You might be able to knock it down to 24 Leafsung Ink if you throw in the Fabric Boots from the Tailor quest and the one Steel Boots you can win from a quest later, but then you'll have no Fabric Boots and no Steel Boots of your own after a lot of grinding. AND YET this isn't as bad as the game gets. If you're running out of quests and getting bored, go ahead and why not.

### Guarding the Path - HuntS2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Quest Path:** (open via Hunt Trail: HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library) • **Guarding the Path** • HuntS2 State of Rest • HuntS2 A Distant Figure
- **Type:** Battle

- **Rewards:** Hunt Map Piece 4, 5 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** This is (per history) going to end up being basically required to progress in the Hunt. Go ahead for it!

### A Happy Prickle - IC

NOTE: This exact quest was offered during the Alien Meteoroid Expedition in July 2020; if you completed it then, it will not be available now.

- **Location:** Impact Crater
- **Unlocked by:** Alien Meteoroid Trail: 3PC A Way North: Up The Mountain
- **Type:** Battle

### Iron On Sand - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** 3PC MQ2/Just Another Brick
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 25 Steel Bars
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest, 1 Wooden Key, and 1 vial Leafsung Ink
- **Recommendations:** It's nice to get a matched Chest/Key set, and Leafsung Ink is always amazing, but bear in mind that the game requires literally hundreds of Steel Bars eventually. And 3PC is probably the easiest place to get them, so it won't get easier to grind them. So it depends on whether your reaction to that is "eh, what's another 25?" or "NOT A SINGLE ONE MORE THAN NECESSARY". 

### It's Bigger Inside - LF

One little Golden Chest won't come near to replacing the resources you spend on it.

- **Requirements:** Collect 50 Desert Stones
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest & 1 Stone Key

### Protect the Mind - Gansu

- **Rewards:** 5 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** Having fun collecting Desert Stones yet? If you finish this, you'll unlock another with the same feel! Stempos *are* awfully nice to have, and these are hardly the most expensive in the game. But if you get tired of Desert Stones, there are alternatives.

### Respark the Flame - Gansu

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Quest Path:** (open via Gansu MQ8) • Gansu Rebuild the Watering Hole • **Respark the Flame** • Gansu Local Shrine • Gansu First Stempo • (ability to craft Stempos), MT Study Break Time
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 5 Stone Blocks, 5 Sandstone Blocks, 10 Hardwood, 20 Desert Stone
- **Rewards:** 1 Stempo (and after more quests, ability to craft them)
- **Recommendations:** Again, do it: ability to craft Stempos is worth it, IMHO. If you're wondering what Hardwood is, you probably haven't run over to Riza yet (and you might need to go fight a few Riza battles to get enough), but that's fine. Go play around in the Riza quests and come on back. 

### Sacred Feathers - Gansu

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Unlocked by:** 3PC MQ5/A Way South
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 10 Sacred Feathers
- **Rewards:** 3 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** If you're seeing this when you first get to Gansu and wondering how you do it, Step 1 is "get to the third Main Quest in Gansu". That's what makes Arenica available. Once you have that, this is exactly as valuable as Stempos are to you. How likely is it that you'll need to reserve days off for your streak, or make up a missed day? Is it worth 5 Steel Daggers and 6750 words (reduced by howevermuch your Attack is)? If so, go for it! Otherwise, it'll keep.

### Safety Hats - LF

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Unlocked by:** available at game open

### Sagacious Sincere Sabu - RLab

- **Location:** Research Lab
- **Quest Path:** (open via Alien Expedition Trail: SpaceS Orders to Repair) • RLab Set Creatures Free! (1/4) • RLab Create a Clearing (2/4) • RLab Build a Biodome (3/4) • RLab Encourage an Ecosystem (4/4) • IN ANY ORDER [RLab Making Mellow Mowow  (*unlocks Mowow in Wilderness*)• **Sagacious Sincere Sabu (*unlocks Sabu in Wilderness*) **• RLab Silkly Sleek Sulanica (*unlocks Sulanica in Wilderness*)• RLab Zappy Zazzy Xombri (*unlocks Xombri in Wilderness*)• RLab Zooty Zanutaki Zings (*unlocks Zanutaki in Wilderness*)]
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 10 Fine Fabric, 5 Fur, and 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Rewards:** 1 Stempo, unlock Sabu
- **Recommendations:** I suspect you already have these on you, unless you've been doing something really intensive lately. And you certainly know places to find these resources by now. Good hunting!

### Sand in Places... - 3PC

- **Location:** Three Points Crossing
- **Unlocked by:** MT MQ4
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 50 Dust, 12 Reenu Wings, 35 Raw Fabric, 3 Rope, and 1 Steel Bar
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Caravan Sandals https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;featured&#95;sandals.png
- **Recommendations:** I love me my Caravan Sandals. I think they are among the cutest wardrobe items available so far in the game. If they're not all that from your perspective, this is definitely skippable. Bear in mind that you'll be wanting half a dozen Reenu Wings for other things later on, so you might want to go back and restock if this breaks the bank.

### Sand Mountain Caravan - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** MT MQ4 / Aid To An Elder

### Sands of Time - 3PC

- **Location:** Three Points Crossing
- **Unlocked by:** MT MQ4
- **Type:** Collection/Crafting
- **Requirements:** Collect 10 Sands Rings and 5 Glass Staffs
- **Rewards:** 5 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** Unless you're desperate for Stempos (lovely lovely streak-holders), this might be better to save until after Gansu Watering Hole. Later Chests drop materials that make part of this quest much easier. Meanwhile, you can start stocking up on the 10 Old Staffs you'll need to craft the Glass Staffs; Mama Tree Wooden Chests are especially good for Old Staffs (and again, you can't have too many Vine Nets from there if you want to complete all quests in this game).

### Save the Children

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Unlocked by:** available at game open

### Scouting The Land - SC

- **Location:** Stone City
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: FB Stone's Throw East

### Scouting the Trees - TT

- **Location:** Tall Trees
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: FB Javelin Toss West

### Searching South - Ruins

- **Location:** Underground Ruins
- **Desert Expedition Trail:** (open via Gansu MQ8/Dust to Dust) • Gansu Digging Into Desert Sands • DigS Question to Axe • IN ANY ORDER: [ **Searching South** • Ruins Navigating North • Ruins Withdrawing West • Ruins Excavating East ] • Ruins Tunnel Locked On • (access to Shrine of Ages)
- **Type:** Words, Battle
- **Requirements:** Write 830 Words, defeat 1 Ripos
- **Rewards:** 5 Raw Gold, progress toward Shrine of Ages
- **Recommendations:** Do it. Ignore the wordcount, you'll get that many words anyway fighting Ripos. (Actually, might want to make sure you've taken all the other directional quests at the same time, so Ripos takes care of extra wordcount.)

### A Season for Hope - HuntS1

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS1 Joining the Hunt

### A Season to Explore - HuntS2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each:
  - Frizi
  - Kiru
  - Grult
  - Desert Wignow
  - Rulo
  - Yasri
  - Bruja
  - Villager
  - Tambo
  - Lombri
- **Rewards:** 100 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** That's 100 Hunter Tokens. That's quite a bit. (Although I'd detour to Mama Tree to fight the Villager, since it's cheaper there.) Go for it! Pro tip: if you haven't finished the Desert yet, you've got plenty of Bruja, Kiru, and Yasri ahead of you; don't go out of your way to fight them. Grult doesn't appear in any other quests, though (apart from Hunt quests).

### Seeing a Sequence - ShrineGO

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Green Ooze Shrine Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat the following:
  - 1 Giant Ooze
  - 2 Giant Ooze Houses
  - 3 Wavi Ooze
  - 5 Wowtri Ooze
  - 8 Froji Ooze
- **Rewards:** 25 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** Make sure you've picked up Green Ooze Invasion to get max effectiveness.

### Seeing It Through - HuntS2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Frizi
- **Rewards:** 5 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** This is a little quest with a little reward. However, if Frizi end up dropping Hunter Tokens at any point, this will be well worth it. 

### Set Creatures Free! (1/4) - RLab

- **Location:** Research Lab
- **Quest Path:** (open via Alien Expedition Trail: SpaceS Orders to Repair) • **Set Creatures Free! (1/4)** • RLab Create a Clearing (2/4) • RLab Build a Biodome (3/4) • RLab Encourage an Ecosystem (4/4) • IN ANY ORDER  [RLab Making Mellow Mowow  (*unlocks Mowow in Wilderness*)• RLab Sagacious Sincere Sabu (*unlocks Sabu in Wilderness*) • RLab Silkly Sleek Sulanica (*unlocks Sulanica in Wilderness*)• RLab Zappy Zazzy Xombri (*unlocks Xombri in Wilderness*)• RLab Zooty Zanutaki Zings (*unlocks Zanutaki in Wilderness*)]
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Captain Piak, 1 Dr. Enoe, 1 Dr. Hogglevoss, and 1 Rosarin
- **Rewards:** 5 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** This quest can't really be evaluated on its own, because it's all about the whole sequence. And I find the whole sequence rewarding, if challenging. It isn't possible to complete and get the ultimate reward until you're halfway through the Floating City of Balance in Oge-Mai, but why not give it a whirl?

### Shadows In Flux - GL

- **Location:** Guardian's Lair
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: FB North: Homeward Bound

### Shaman's Hideout

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** LF MQ4

### Shrine Creature Flyby - Shrine TFA

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Terror From Above Shrine Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each:
  - Murciel
  - Lupo
  - Fools' Lorsa
  - Fools' Lorsa Halloween
  - Arir
  - Witch's Memoirs
  - Untu Ship
- **Rewards:** 50 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** Isn't this why you're in the Shrine? Fight new monsters, win Shrine Stones? Go for it!

### The Shrine-Stone Trail - ShrineGiant

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Giants Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Caravans
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Tambo Mane https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;644-tambo-mane-3765-86009.png
- **Recommendations:** This monster is intimdating for low-output writers, but it's honestly not that bad. If you have >+21 Attack and >+15 Defense, it's less than 1K/day in actuality. If that's still too gruelling, write offsite and paste in. And if you're a high-output writer, glory in the great loot of the Caravan.

### Silkly Sleek Sulanica

- **Location:** Research Lab
- **Quest Path:** (open via Alien Expedition Trail: SpaceS Orders to Repair) • RLab Set Creatures Free! (1/4) • RLab Create a Clearing (2/4) • RLab Build a Biodome (3/4) • RLab Encourage an Ecosystem (4/4) • IN ANY ORDER: [RLab Making Mellow Mowow  (*unlocks Mowow in Wilderness*)• RLab Sagacious Sincere Sabu (*unlocks Sabu in Wilderness*) • **Silkly Sleek Sulanica (*unlocks Sulanica in Wilderness*)**• RLab Zappy Zazzy Xombri (*unlocks Xombri in Wilderness*)• RLab Zooty Zanutaki Zings (*unlocks Zanutaki in Wilderness*)]
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 3 White Fur, 3 Sacred Feather, 5 Raw Fabric, and 10 Glass Shards
- **Rewards:** 1 Stempo, unlock Sulanica
- **Recommendations:** The process of gathering 3 White Fur and 3 Sacred Feathers should remind you how useful it could be to have a monster that consistently drops both for only a thousand words. Invaluable for Stempo production, once you've unlocked the ability to craft Stempos.

### Sleepless in Stone City - SC

- **Location:** Stone City
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: FB Stone's Throw East

### Slowest Tortoise Wins - SC

- **Location:** Stone City
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: FB Stone's Throw East

### Snake Pit - Gansu

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Unlocked by:** 3PC MQ5/A Way South
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 25 Ylly
- **Rewards:** 5 Gold Bars
- **Recommendations:** Do it whenever you have a chance, if you like long sidequests at all. The Gold Bars are a lackluster prize, but at least it's *some* extra prize while you earn Ylly's drops, which are invaluable in later quests.

### Sparks to Ignite (3/3) - SpaceS

- **Location:** Spaceship
- **Quest Path:** (open via Alien Expedition Trail: IC Learning to Breathe) • SpaceS An Alien Exam (Part 1 of 2) • SpaceS Studying Space Scientists (Part 2 of 2) • **Sparks to Ignite (3/3)** 
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 each:
  - Szalin
  - Nedi
  - Skarn
  - Rosarin
  - Ame
  - Dr. Hogglevoss
  - Zals
  - Dr. Enoe

  - Tessen
  - Minica
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: OnFire Lab Coat https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1105-onfire-lab-coat-7962-37242.png
- **Recommendations:** You've come this far! ... who am I kidding, at 84K battle words, this is one of the most demanding quests in the game. Still, it provides a nice long-term thing to have in the background when the frenzied rush of short-term quests has subsided.

### Spooky Scary Supernaturals - ShrineMar

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Marionette Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each: Osemar, Zosimos, Zosimaga, Zosimas, Zosimalus, Balatros, Balatrix, Balatras
- **Rewards:** 50 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** None needed

### Spreading Hope - HuntS1

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS1 Joining the Hunt

### A Squirming Nest - DigS

- **Location:** Dig Site
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Gansu Digging Into Desert Sands
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 100 Loi
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Lombri Hat https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1033-lombri-hat-7567-63630.png
- **Recommendations:** Well, it's not a priority for me because I prefer shorter to-do lists even if they're large chunks, but it would be nice to just set Loi on an infinity loop for a while and see how much of this gets knocked out.

### Stabbing Dinti Spikes - IC

- **Location:** Impact Crater
- **Unlocked by:** Alien Meteoroid Trail: 3PC A Way North: Up The Mountain
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Krang, 3 Erbor, 10 Halix, and 4 Galatre
- **Rewards:** 3 Stempos & Wardrobe: Rock Skirt https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;885-rock-skirt-6154-61176.png
- **Recommendations:** This quest involves 3 monsters from much deeper in the Alien Meteoroid, but it could be nice to get all the Erbor stuff out of the way together.

### State of Rest - HuntS2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Quest Path:** (open via Hunt Trail: HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library) • HuntS2 Guarding the Path • **State of Rest** • HuntS2 A Distant Figure
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Pipit
- **Rewards:** Hunt Map Piece 5, 5 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** We've settled into a pattern where one Ancient's Assistant quest unlocks another, which unlocks another, and provides Map Pieces to further the Hunt. Have fun getting to know Pipit and progressing in the Hunt! Don't forget to check off the Oh, Endless Possibilities quest when you're done!

### Sticks & Stones - ShrineGiant

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Giants Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Skuppa's Giant Marionette and 5 Untu Golem
- **Rewards:** 25 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** This is the second-easiest quest in this area, and you'll end up with 75 Shrine Stones including the ones you net from battles. Go for it!

### Stone City Chaos - SC

- **Location:** Stone City
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: FB Stone's Throw East

### Stone Collector - Gansu

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Unlocked by:** 3PC MQ5/A Way South
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 100 Desert Stones
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest & 1 Stone Key
- **Recommendations:** If this will be quick, or you like hunting Desert Stones, go for it! Be aware, though, that there are a LOT of Desert Stone requirements in both main and sidequests for a while, and you might want to wait on spending what you have. (And there's an easier sidequest with the same rewards if you wait a bit.)

### Stone's Throw East - FB

- **Location:** Forward Base
- **Forest Expedition Trail Route:** (open via MT MQ4 / Aid To An Elder) • MT New Adventurous Horizons •  BC Hard Day's Walk • FB Feeding the Lighthouse • IN ANY ORDER [FB Javelin Toss West • FB North: Homeward Bound • **Stone's Throw East**]

### Stop Clowning Around - ShrineMar

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Marionette Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 each: Balatros, Balatrix, Balatras
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Clown Eyes https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;clown&#95;eyes.png
- **Recommendations:** None needed

### Strengthening Your Adaptiveness 5/5 - HuntS2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Quest Path:** (open via Hunt Trail: HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library) • HuntS2 Strengthening Your Loyalty • HuntS2 Strengthening Your Viewpoint 2/3 • HuntS2 Strengthening Your Friendship 3/3 • HuntS2 Strengthening Your Timing 4/5 • **Strengthening Your Adaptiveness 5/5** 
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Kapir
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Chest Side Belts https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;657-chest-side-belts-3903-85263.png
- **Recommendations:** Note that Kapir are also required for Dazzling Desert Diversity, so consider having that at the ready. Otherwise... you're good!

### Strengthening Your Friendship 3/3 - HuntS2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Quest Path:** (open via Hunt Trail: HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library) • HuntS2 Strengthening Your Loyalty • HuntS2 Strengthening Your Viewpoint 2/3 • **Strengthening Your Friendship 3/3** • HuntS2 Strengthening Your Timing 4/5 • HuntS2 Strengthening Your Adaptiveness 5/5
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Wetu (Gansu)
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** 3 Wetu are a cinch if you're used to writing >1000 words/day; they're a bit more of a challenge if you're on the slower side. Feel free to wait and watch on this one.

### Strengthening Your Loyalty - HuntS2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Quest Path:** (open via Hunt Trail: HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library) • **Strengthening Your Loyalty** • HuntS2 Strengthening Your Viewpoint 2/3 • HuntS2 Strengthening Your Friendship 3/3 • HuntS2 Strengthening Your Timing 4/5 • HuntS2 Strengthening Your Adaptiveness 5/5
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Grult
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** EDITED 24 Apr 2020 - Suspicions justified! Currently 3 quests in this chain. Original recommendation: I'm suspicious. The naming convention sounds a bit like the "Proving Your..." series from Season 1 - will this become a series? Or does "wandering" mean fewer sequential things? It's a pretty small quest, in the end, and hey, Grult are the most efficient sources of XP in the game right now.

### Strengthening Your Timing 4/5 - HuntS2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Quest Path:** (open via Hunt Trail: HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library) • HuntS2 Strengthening Your Loyalty • HuntS2 Strengthening Your Viewpoint 2/3 • HuntS2 Strengthening Your Friendship 3/3 • **Strengthening Your Timing 4/5** • HuntS2 Strengthening Your Adaptiveness 5/5
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Ripos
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Pretty self-evident. If you manage to knock this out this month (before 24 June 2020), Ripos will be dropping Hunter Tokens, too, so it'll get you 28. Good time to tackle it.

### Strengthening Your Viewpoint 2/3 - HuntS2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Quest Path:** (open via Hunt Trail: HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library) • HuntS2 Strengthening Your Loyalty • **Strengthening Your Viewpoint 2/3** • HuntS2 Strengthening Your Friendship 3/3 • HuntS2 Strengthening Your Timing 4/5 • HuntS2 Strengthening Your Adaptiveness 5/5
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each:
  - Rulo (3PC, Gansu)
  - Sparfly (Gansu, Riza)
  - Ylly (Gansu)
  - Desert Wignow (3PC, Gansu)
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** I KNEW IT! I knew Strengthening Your Loyalty was part 1 of a chain! If this is parallel to Season 1, then this quest chain will have mediocre rewards until it ends, at which point you might have some very cool wardrobe in store. Might. Anyway, I like that several of these monsters have valuable drops and none of them have requirements; go for it!

### Study Break Time - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Quest Path:** (open via Gansu MQ8) • Gansu Rebuild the Watering Hole • Gansu Respark the Flame • Gansu Local Shrine • Gansu First Stempo • (ability to craft Stempos), **Study Break Time** 
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Pay 10 Stempos
- **Rewards:** 3 Wooden Keys & 3 Wooden Chests
- **Recommendations:** Before Wooden Chests were added to the rewards, my recommendation was as follows: "For completionists only. 10 Stempos are ridiculously more valuable than 3 Wooden Keys, so unless you have dozens on hand you don't expect to use or you're desperate to complete every. single. quest… skip this."
  Now that Wooden Chests have been added, my recommendation is... pretty much the same. It's no longer insanely imbalanced, but the average player will get more use out of 10 Stempos than 3 Wooden Key/Chest pairs. Unless you have 10 Stempos you won't otherwise use, which is possible if you've accumulated a lot.

### Studying Space Scientists (Part 2 of 2) - SpaceS

NOTE: This exact quest was offered during the Alien Meteoroid Expedition in July 2020; if you completed it then, it will not be available now.

- **Location:** Spaceship
- **Quest Path:** (open via Alien Expedition Trail: IC Learning to Breathe) • SpaceS An Alien Exam (Part 1 of 2) • **Studying Space Scientists (Part 2 of 2)** • SpaceS Sparks to Ignite (3/3)
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 2 each: 
  - Nedi
  - Skarn
  - Szalin
  - Rosarin
  - Ame
  - Dr. Hogglevoss
  - Zals
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Graffiti Lab Coat https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;944-grafitti-lab-coat-6855-53845.png
- **Recommendations:** No rush at the moment! Take when you like, finish what you like.

### Studying Substance Samples - HuntS1

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS1 Joining the Hunt

### Stumbling Upon Sheep - HuntS2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Hunt Trail Route:** (unlocked via LF MQ4/Don't Regift Curses) • MT The Winding Path to Elder Library • HuntS1 Joining the Hunt • HuntS1 The Hunt Begins • HuntS1 Deeper Forest Hunting • HuntS1 A Past Not Forgotten • HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library • HuntS2 All Who Wander • HuntS2 Oh, Endless Possibilities! • HuntS2 No Wrong Path • **Stumbling Upon Sheep** • HuntS3 To Grow & Change • HuntS3 Bettering Ourselves • HuntS3 Bigger & Brighter • HuntS3 A Bubble Dream • HuntS4 Dirt to Dust • HuntS4 Celebrate Joy • HuntS4 Still Missing Something • HuntS4 Proving Your Friendship
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Shepherd
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Dog Mentor Pet https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;862-dog-mentor-pet-6004-63771.png
- **Recommendations:** This is the end of the Season 2 quests! And the Pipit pet is ADORABLE. Beat that Shepherd down!

### Sturdy Wooden Fence - FB

- **Location:** Forward Base
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: BC Hard Day's Walk

### Style is Eternal

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Quest Path Route:** available at game open • LF Make It Work • **Style Is Eternal** 

### Swing, Sway, Summon - TT

- **Location:** Tall Trees
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: FB Javelin Toss West

### Tailor - 3PC

- **Location:** Three Points Crossing
- **Unlocked by:** MT MQ4
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 30 Red Dye
- **Rewards:**1 Fabric Boots, 3 Stone Keys, 1 Stempo
- **Recommendations:** Definitely do this, but I wouldn't actively pursue it till you're done with the Three Points Crossing Main Quests. Red Dye tends to slowly accumulate as you play, and you'll get a better feel for the best sources as you work your way around the Desert. (Oh, and if you're wondering what Stone Keys are… they're Keys, what more do you need to know right now???)

### Tears and Feathers - ShrineCar

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Carnival Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Halores
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Carnival Mask https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;646-carnival-mask-3781-45288.png
- **Recommendations:** I happen to adore the mask and recommend going for this as a priority. It does have only the one variant, so it's not like there's a chance of getting a different one you like better, but... fun! Also, I like all the Carnival monsters, so fighting 5 Halores is an appealing prospect.

### Technology & Dinti - SpaceS

- **Location:** Spaceship
- **Alien Expedition Trail:** (open via 3PC MQ5/A Way South) • 3PC A Way North: Up The Mountain • IC Learning to Breathe • IN ANY ORDER: [**Technology & Dinti** • SpaceS Orders to Repair]
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 20 Wood, 5 Steel, 20 Rope, and 5 Stone
- **Rewards:** Unlock Mining Site
- **Recommendations:** This unlocks the way to the Dinti Shop, for anyone who didn't clear it out initially. Definitely worth a look.

### Testing the Valley - RLab

- **Location:** Research Lab
- **Unlocked by:** Alien Expedition Trail: SpaceS Orders to Repair
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Dr. Enoe, and deliver:
  - 3 Reenu Wings
  - 2 Spider Poison
  - 3 Nuig String
  - 1 Vezi Shell
  - 10 Bones
  - 2 Refined Dust
  - 2 Kapir Tuft
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Drill Bracelet https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1092-drill-bracelet-7908-26970.png
- **Recommendations:** This is A Lot for a relatively small reward.  The items range from Luciola Forest (Reenu Wings) to Dark Forest Outpost (Bones) with a sidestep into Desert Expedition (Kapir Tuft). So it's mostly a matter of pride to deliver, and a use for items you might happen to accumulate as you close out the main quest sequence. (At least the Drill Bracelet comes in Left, Right, and Both Wrists?)

### There She Blows - ShrineGO

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Green Ooze Shrine Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Whaly Ooze
- **Rewards:** 25 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** Don't forget about the Green Ooze Invasion quest while you're here!

### Thieving Glowing Rocks - MSite

- **Location:** Mining Site
- **Unlocked by:** Alien Expedition Trail: SpaceS Technology & Dinti
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Ityf
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Exoskeleton https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1093-exoeskeleton-7914-33237.png
- **Recommendations:** There are a lot of quests here that need no extra recommendations, so here's a boilerplate to say this is one of them. :)

### Thinking Like Ink (4/5) - MT

- **Requirements:** Collect 250 Wood, 100 Rope, 25 Stone

- **Unlocked by:** MT MQ4
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 8 Rusty Amulet, 8 Rusty Pendant, 20 Dust

### Weekly: Monster Hunter

- **Location:** Global
- **Route:** none needed; globally available from the start

### When Tylu Portal - ShrineFools

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Fools' Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle

### White Coat - Gansu

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Unlocked by:** 3PC MQ5/A Way South
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 10 White Fur
- **Rewards:** 3 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** Same as with Sacred Feathers, if you're seeing this when you first get to Gansu and wondering how you do it, Step 1 is "get to the third Main Quest in Gansu". That's what makes Suulan available. They're very reliable about dropping White Fur, so you'll need a fairly predictable 5-10 Steel Daggers and 10,000 words to beat this quest, but I'd save it till after you're done with the rest of Gansu and its various White Fur needs. (Also, be aware that coming back to this after you reach the Dust Region will give you more options for White Fur sources.)

- **Type:** Words, Battle
- **Requirements:** Write 670 words, defeat 1 Griffe

- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Fools' Wrimo

### Zappy Zazzy Xombri - RLab

- **Location:** Research Lab
- **Quest Path:** (open via Alien Expedition Trail: SpaceS Orders to Repair) • RLab Set Creatures Free! (1/4) • RLab Create a Clearing (2/4) • RLab Build a Biodome (3/4) • RLab Encourage an Ecosystem (4/4) • IN ANY ORDER [RLab Making Mellow Mowow  (*unlocks Mowow in Wilderness*)• RLab Sagacious Sincere Sabu (*unlocks Sabu in Wilderness*) • RLab Silkly Sleek Sulanica (*unlocks Sulanica in Wilderness*)• **Zappy Zazzy Xombri (*unlocks Xombri in Wilderness*)**• RLab Zooty Zanutaki Zings (*unlocks Zanutaki in Wilderness*)]

- **Requirements:** Deliver 25 Dust, 15 Rope, 10 Desert Stones, and 3 Fur
- **Rewards:** 1 Stempo, unlock Xombri
- **Recommendations:** There are a lot of quests here that need no extra recommendations, so here's a boilerplate to say this is one of them. :)

### Zilya's Defensive Lorsa - 3PC

- **Location:** Three Points Crossing
- **Unlocked by:** MT MQ4
- **Type:** Collection 
- **Requirements:** Collect/Craft 10 Lorsa nests
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest
- **Recommendations:** You have SO MANY other uses for Wood (and Leaves, for that matter) besides building Lorsa Nests right now. Go ahead, if it makes you happy; you'll have more opportunities to build Lorsa Nests later, too. I wouldn't prioritize this.

### Zooty Zanutaki Zings - RLab

- **Location:** Research Lab
- **Quest Path:** (open via Alien Expedition Trail: SpaceS Orders to Repair) • RLab Set Creatures Free! (1/4) • RLab Create a Clearing (2/4) • RLab Build a Biodome (3/4) • RLab Encourage an Ecosystem (4/4) • IN ANY ORDER [RLab Making Mellow Mowow  (*unlocks Mowow in Wilderness*)• RLab Sagacious Sincere Sabu (*unlocks Sabu in Wilderness*) • RLab Silkly Sleek Sulanica (*unlocks Sulanica in Wilderness*)• RLab Zappy Zazzy Xombri (*unlocks Xombri in Wilderness*)• **Zooty Zanutaki Zings (*unlocks Zanutaki in Wilderness*)**]
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 15 Glass Shards, 10 Nuig String, 10 Dried Pulp, and 2 Tambo Mane
- **Rewards:** 1 Stempo, unlock Zanutaki
- **Recommendations:** Welp, you're up against Dried Pulp in this, which means you'll need to have unlocked Dark Forest Outpost to complete this. And honestly it makes sense that you need something from the Dust-haunted Dark Forest to unlock this nightmare of a creature. And so far, Zanutaki are not required for any quests. And Nuig String isn't cheap, unless you've been battling a lot in Balance for other reasons. This... is not something I'd prioritize.
