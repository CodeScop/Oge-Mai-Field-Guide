LAST UPDATED 5 MAR 2021

The SHRINE OF AGES! This is a weird and wonderful place where time shifts unpredictably. Which is a fancy way of saying that past events are alive here... *if* you know how to look.

**Note: if you've already looked and you just want to know what's new, skip to the New section after this one.**

It looks pretty empty at first glance: only one unique monster, one quest. You'll need to take a beeline to Town to the **Shrine Bracelets: Stempos or Tickets** section to unlock the potential. Buy yourself a Bracelet for any event(s) that look interesting. You should have received a Shrine Ticket for every time you've leveled up in the game, and by now that should be enough to get you started here. (If you need to purchase Shrine Tickets with Stempos, well, I talk plenty about how to get Stempos in the Gansu recap.)

Now, to transform the Shrine. Go to your Wardrobe section and equip one of the Bracelets.

After you save it, notice how the Wilderness fills up with monsters. The Shrine Quests provide options, and the Wardrobe Rewards section fills up with items to be purchased with Shrine Stones.

Switch Bracelets, and all this changes.

Have at it.

**My Shrine Notes will be mostly divided by Bracelet.** That is to say, I'll discuss resources, monsters, and quests grouped by which Bracelet makes them appear. (It's worth noting that cheaper Bracelets seem to give fewer monsters and quests.) **I also have a Wardrobe section available after all the regular Bracelet sections** to summarize all the Wardrobe available, for anyone who wants to browse (but at the end so it's easy for anyone else to skip).

**Want a preview?** Each Bracelet premiered with a banner listing images of all the monsters and wardrobe items it unlocks. I've saved those banners here: https://github.com/CodeScop/Oge-Mai-Field-Guide/tree/master/bannershrine

There are currently 11 Bracelets available (listing alphabetically):

- Birds Time Bracelet - 3 Shrine Tickets (released 14 May 2020, based on the Carnival NaNoWriMo event November 2018). Fairly easy, colorful bird monsters, excellent wardrobe options.
- Carnival Time Bracelet - 3 Shrine Tickets (released 22 Jun 2020, also based on the Carnival NaNoWriMo event from Nov 2018) Easy to challenging colorful monsters with colorful wardrobe.
- Colorful Ooze Bracelet - 3 Shrine Tickets (released 22 Jun 2020, based on the July 2018 Camp NaNo Ooze event and the Nov 2018 NaNo Carnival event) A little sparse on quests, but very generous with easy, colorful monsters
- Ducks Time Bracelet - 3 Shrine Tickets (released 17 Mar 2020, based on the duck-themed Leap Day event around 29 Feb 2020) Easy, playful ducks.
- Fools' Time Bracelet - 3 Shrine Tickets (released 22 Jun 2020, based on the Camp NaNo in April 2017 and the Halloween event in 2017) Very Halloweeny; small monsters with very small timers, for the most part, and small-scale generally
- Giants Time Bracelet - 10 Shrine Tickets (released 14 May 2020, based on multiple big-boss monsters from multiple previous events) Challenging monsters & quests
- Green Ooze Shrine Bracelet - 5 Shrine Tickets  (released 4 Feb 2020, based on Green Ooze Camp Nano events from 2018) Wide range of ooze monsters and quests and wardrobe.
- Marionette Bracelet (called the "Skull & Clown Marionette Bracelet" in the store and nowhere else) - 5 Shrine Tickets (released 17 Mar 2020, based on various haunted carnival NaNo events) Largely spooky, somewhat challenging monsters & quests
- NPC Time Bracelet (technically Special Event NPC Time Bracelet but I'm saving myself typing) - 5 Shrine Tickets (released 5 Mar 2021, based on multiple 2017-2018 NaNo events) Mid- to large-range monsters, essential to lore-hungry players and skippable for most others
- Polygon Time Bracelet - 3 Shrine Tickets (released 17 Mar 2020, based on the geometry-themed Pi Day event 14 Mar-17 Mar 2020) Cute, colorful, generally easy monsters and a variety of simple quests
- Special Event NPC Time Bracelet - see NPC Time Bracelet
- Terror From Above Shrine Bracelet - 3 Shrine Tickets (released 4 Feb 2020, based on haunting & tricks themed events) Haunted house hodgepodge; handful of different battle quests

**But before we get to the divided notes, let's briefly note the open markets and other open info.**

You don't need a Bracelet to see the Chests & Keys, or to see the Reaction Market, but you will need a Bracelet to see most of the monsters that drop the Shrine Stones that are used as currency in these stores. (What monsters drop Shrine Stones? All of them. At least, "all of them" that aren't the global monsters like Xin jut hanging around because they're everywhere.) And if you want to see anything in the Wardrobe area, you'll need to be equipped.

Any Chest or Key available in the game is available for sale in the Chests & Keys section.

- Wooden Chest & Wooden Key: 25 Shrine Stones each
- Golden Chest & Leafsung Key: 50 Shrine Stones each
- Stone Chest & Stone Key: 75 Shrine Stones each
- River Chest & River Key: 100 Shrine Stones Each
- Bones Chest & Bone Key: 150 Shrine Stones Each

The Reaction Market sells Reactions for 1 Shrine Stone each. Here's what's available as of the opening (and fair warning: I might not keep close track of this as it changes. I assume it will just offer All The Reactions All The Time, but we don't know yet)

## Shrine Open Monster

Motes wasn't around till about a year after the Shrine opened in its current iteration, although his spot in the Lorebook Bestiary was waiting, and I'm so excited to see him that I'm listing him before his quests.

### Motes

- **Unlocked by:** opening Shrine
- **Requirements:** 1000 words
- **Time allowed:** 180 minutes (3 hours)
- **XP:** 100
- **Drops:** 10 Shrine Stones, 17-25 Coins, 1-2 Rope, 1-3 Raw Fabric, 1-2 Raw Stone
- **Quests:** Shrine: Keeper of the Shrine 1/3 (1), Helper of the Shrine 2/3 (2), Guardian of the Shrine 3/3 (3)

## Shrine Open Quests

###Keeper of the Shrine 1/3

- **Unlocked by:** open Shrine of Ages
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Motes
- **Rewards:** 1 Shrine Ticket
- **Recommendations:**  This is the easiest Shrine Ticket left in the game by the time you get here. Are you telling me you don't want Shrine Tickets?

###Helper of the Shrine 2/3

- **Unlocked by:** Shrine Quest Keeper of the Shrine 1/3
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 2 Motes, deliver 15 Desert Stones
- **Rewards:** 2 Shrine Tickets
- **Recommendations:** The last quest had the easiest Shrine Ticket left; this has the easiest two left after that. Fully worth it, in my book. (Even if Desert Stones are pretty in demand in Desert things, at least this is only 15.)

###Guardian of the Shrine 3/3

- **Unlocked by:** Shrine Quest Helper of the Shrine 2/3
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Motes, deliver 25 Desert Stones and 25 River Stones
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Motes Stone Belt https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1501-merchant-stone-belt-10181-25983.png
- **Recommendations:**  This is up to you. People with long memories of when the Shrine was first introduced might wonder whether this belt has any special properties - poking around, I've found none (though I've only done a cursory check).  Do remember that River Stones are both easier to get and more in demand to spend late in the Water Region, especially the Raina Expedition, so possibly avoid doing this quest until you've evaluated how that part of the game affects your choices here.



**And now, on to the Bracelet-specific info! Listed in the order they're listed above: alphabetically.**
