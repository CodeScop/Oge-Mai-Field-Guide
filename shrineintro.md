The SHRINE OF AGES! This is a weird and wonderful place where time shifts unpredictably. Which is a fancy way of saying that past events are alive here... *if* you know how to look.

It looks pretty empty at first glance. You'll need to take a beeline to Town to the **Shrine Bracelets: Stempos or Tickets** section to unlock the potential. Buy yourself a Bracelet for any event(s) that look interesting. You should have received a Shrine Ticket for every time you've leveled up in the game, and by now that should be enough to get you started here. (If you need to purchase Shrine Tickets with Stempos, well, I talk plenty about how to get Stempos in the Gansu recap.)

Now, to transform the Shrine. Go to your Wardrobe section and equip one of the Bracelets.

After you save it, notice how the Wilderness fills up with monsters. The Shrine Quests provide options, and the Wardrobe Rewards section fills up with items to be purchased with Shrine Stones.

Switch Bracelets, and all this changes.

Have at it.

**My Shrine Notes will be mostly divided by Bracelet.** That is to say, I'll discuss resources, monsters, and quests grouped by which Bracelet makes them appear. (It's worth noting that cheaper Bracelets seem to give fewer monsters and quests.) **I also have a Wardrobe section available after all the regular Bracelet sections** to summarize all the Wardrobe available, for anyone who wants to browse (but at the end so it's easy for anyone else to skip).

**Want a preview?** Each Bracelet premiered with a banner listing images of all the monsters and wardrobe items it unlocks. I've saved those banners here: https://github.com/CodeScop/Oge-Mai-Field-Guide/tree/master/bannershrine

There are currently 7 Bracelets available (listing alphabetically):

- Birds Time Bracelet - 3 Shrine Tickets (released 14 May 2020, based on the Carnival NaNoWriMo event November 2018)
- Ducks Time Bracelet - 3 Shrine Tickets (released 17 Mar 2020, based on the duck-themed Leap Day event around 29 Feb 2020)
- Giants Time Bracelet - 10 Shrine Tickets (released 14 May 2020, based on multiple big-boss monsters from multiple previous events)
- Green Ooze Shrine Bracelet - 5 Shrine Tickets  (released 4 Feb 2020, based on Green Ooze Camp Nano events from 2018)
- Marionette Bracelet (called the "Skull & Clown Marionette Bracelet" in the store and nowhere else) - 5 Shrine Tickets (released 17 Mar 2020, based on various haunted carnival NaNo events)
- Polygon Time Bracelet - 3 Shrine Tickets (released 17 Mar 2020, based on the geometry-themed Pi Day event 14 Mar-17 Mar 2020)
- Terror From Above Shrine Bracelet - 3 Shrine Tickets (released 4 Feb 2020, based on haunting & tricks themed events)

**But before we get to the divided notes, let's briefly note the open markets.**

You don't need a Bracelet to see the Chests & Keys, or to see the Reaction Market, but you will need a Bracelet to see the monsters that drop the Shrine Stones that are used as currency in these stores. (What monsters drop Shrine Stones? All of them. That become visible with a Bracelet.)

Any Chest or Key available in the game is available for sale in the Chests & Keys section.

- Wooden Chest & Wooden Key: 25 Shrine Stones each
- Golden Chest & Leafsung Key: 50 Shrine Stones each
- Stone Chest & Stone Key: 75 Shrine Stones each
- River Chest & River Key: 100 Shrine Stones Each
- Bones Chest & Bone Key: 150 Shrine Stones Each

The Reaction Market sells Reactions for 1 Shrine Stone each. Here's what's available as of the opening (and fair warning: I might not keep close track of this as it changes. I assume it will just offer All The Reactions All The Time, but we don't know yet)
