Before anything else, check out the New Dust Warrior Guide for game working: https://4thewords.com/page/new-dust-warrior-guide

Note: This is NOT a comprehensive FAQ. I listed a number of helpful resources in the Intro, and they seem to cover the basics. I'm going more literally: the Questions that are Frequently Asked on the Forums. If you've been playing the game for a bit, this is likely to be completely unnecessary; go ahead and skip to your current region.

### How do I use these weapons?

Certain resources are equippable (they're listed as Battle Items in your resources). They'll have three stats listed: Attack, Defense, and Luck. If you click on the resource, select "Equip", and then select "Equip Item", it should fill a slot. (Wood Swords, for instance, have an Attack of +1, but 0 Defense and 0 Luck, and they fill the Weapon1 slot.) There are six slots at the beginning of the game:

**Head, Chest, Feet, Weapon1, Weapon2,** and **Accessory**. Definitely make use of what the game gives you for free. Think carefully about whether you want to shell out to make them otherwise.

### What are Attack, Defense, and Luck stats? (Or: Why are my word counters off?) 

**Attack** makes each word you type count as extra words in your battle. (Note that this ONLY affects your Battle Words, in your fight against a monster. Your daily words and document words will stay as a 1-to-1 match with what you actually type.) Each Attack point adds 1%, or one word for every 100 words you type. So an attack of +1 will give you credit for 1.01 battle words for every 1.00 words you type. An attack of +12 will give you 1.12 battle words for every 1.00 words you type. So if you have an attack of +4, it'll only take you 250/1.04 (or 241, if we round up) words to beat a Wignow.

**Defense** gives you extra time. Each Defense point gives you 0.5% more time. So a Wignow which normally gives you 30 minutes to battle, with a +4 Defense will give you 30 * 1.02 (or about quite 31) minutes to battle. That's not much, but if you're fighting a Grey's Mawt, you get an extra 5 minutes. And as you progress in the game, Defense scores of over 50 become possible.

**Luck** increases the odds that you get drops. This is a little tricky to measure; many drops are completely unaffected by Luck, while others are on a sliding scale of "it's not going to happen" up to "extremely reliable" depending on how much Luck you have. (I try to note on resources when your odds of getting 0 of a drop are highly Luck-dependent, but Luck is a shifting factor and I can't promise to get it right.) The deeper you go in the game, the more Luck you'll want as a baseline. As a general rule, I'd say that you can't gauge what a monster or chest will drop unless you have at least +5 Luck, preferably +10 (don't worry that you'll have to start out with nothing and can't get +10 until fairly deep into the game, just... to give you an idea about how much I prioritize getting Luck-enhancing equipment). Up to +20 still makes a noticeable difference, but you're starting to get into the zone where it really helps more to have more Attack when battling monsters (ultimately fewer words to get resources). My latest Luck survey shows some rare cases where Luck continues being increasingly useful all the way to +50, but those cases are extremely rare. Many experienced players will tell you that +10 or +11 is their limit, and it seems to suit.

But keep your eyes open for your own conclusions! Luck shifts more often than I update my FAQ. :)

### Why isn't this weapon/item of clothing working properly?

Maybe it isn't! (In which case, contact the devs; they're lovely.) But before you decide that, remember that it can be hard sometimes to tell the difference between **Inventory** items (specifically **Battle** items) which can be equipped, and **Wardrobe** items which are for dressing your avatar. There is absolutely zero overlap between the two. Some quests give rewards for one, some for the other, and they can be hard to tell apart. The giveaway is that Wardrobe items are always shown on the gray figure of an avatar stand-in, while Inventory items stand alone.

### How do I open this chest?  

Do you have a key? Wooden Chests currently need Wooden Keys to open. Golden Chests need Leafsung Keys, and Stone Chests need Stone Keys.

### How do I open this chest? I have a key and everything!

Go into Town, to the Item Shop section (usually the first section, a la Alex's Shop). There should be an option to pick your Chest, and if you have both a Chest and a Key, it'll let you open it.
