LAST UPDATED 21 APR 2021

This is quite a bit simpler than my Quest Summaries for the regular Guide - the Shrine (so far!) doesn't have complex quest chains twining around. The quest chain that is there, you'll notice that I still list the **Quest Path**, where I list all the different quests in the chain for each quest in the chain.

All quests listed in alphabetical order :)

- **Recommendations:** Pace yourself. The Untu Golem will be the most challenging if you write onsite - 12 minutes is not much time to write 500 words. The Caravan will be the most endurance-demanding for lower-output writers, although if you have a sufficiently high Defense (like, anything over 16) you'll have 4 days to write 5K words, and if you can scrape >+44 Defense it'll be 5 days.

  - Fools' Mawt
  - Fools' Mawt (Halloween)

- **Rewards:** 50 Shrine Stones

### Gather Lucky Stars - ShrineCO

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Colorful Ooze Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Sothai
- **Rewards:** 15 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** I have a weakness for Sothai purely because the original event had a pretty wardrobe reward attached to Sothai battles. But objectively, this is... another quest! Decide what you want to do with it!

### Green Be Gone! - ShrineCO

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Colorful Ooze Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each:
  - Afeppti
  - Crilum
  - Eguley
  - Elobre
  - Fraite
  - Kenkom
  - Lekhop
  - Otpar
  - Roaki
  - Sothai
  - Spodo
  - Zainga
- **Rewards:** 50 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** Obviously you pick this up immediately so that you can double up any other quests. It's not quite as intimidating as it looks: there might be a dozen monsters, but they're mostly quite tiny.

### Green Ooze Invasion - ShrineGO

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Green Ooze Shrine Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each:
  - Mini Ooze
  - Tryi Ooze

###Guardian of the Shrine 3/3 - Shrine0

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Quest Path:** (open via Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On) • Shrine0 Keeper of the Shrine 1/3 • Shrine0 Helper of the Shrine 2/3 • **Guardian of the Shrine 3/3**
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Motes, deliver 25 Desert Stones and 25 River Stones
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Motes Stone Belt https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1501-merchant-stone-belt-10181-25983.png
- **Recommendations:**  This is up to you. People with long memories of when the Shrine was first introduced might wonder whether this belt has any special properties - poking around, I've found none (though I've only done a cursory check).  Do remember that River Stones are both easier to get and more in demand to spend late in the Water Region, especially the Raina Expedition, so possibly avoid doing this quest until you've evaluated how that part of the game affects your choices here.

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Quest Path:** (open via Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On) • Shrine0 Keeper of the Shrine 1/3 • **Helper of the Shrine 2/3** • Shrine0 Guardian of the Shrine 3/3
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 2 Motes, deliver 15 Desert Stones
- **Rewards:** 2 Shrine Tickets
- **Recommendations:** The last quest had the easiest Shrine Ticket left; this has the easiest two left after that. Fully worth it, in my book. (Even if Desert Stones are pretty in demand in Desert things, at least this is only 15.)

### Helping A Mother - ShrineDucks

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Ducks Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Natida
- **Rewards:** 25 Shrine Stones

###Keeper of the Shrine 1/3 - Shrine0

- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Motes
- **Rewards:** 1 Shrine Ticket
- **Recommendations:**  This is the easiest Shrine Ticket left in the game by the time you get here. Are you telling me you don't want Shrine Tickets?

### The Math's Correct... - ShrinePoly

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Polygon Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 25 Cubed Frizi

- **Recommendations:**  Look, you didn't buy that Bracelet to NOT fight all the monsters here and add them to your Bestiary. You know you didn't. Go ahead and get them! And get a new pair of pants while you're at it!

### Paint Battle - ShrineDucks

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Ducks Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 each: Aita, Tian, Dati
- **Rewards:** 25 Shrine Stones

### Peace and Sunflowers - ShrineCar

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Carnival Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 2 Mahor
- **Rewards:** 30 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** Exactly what it looks like. And Mahor maintains a NaNo pace (one Mahor at zero attack will equal 1/30 of 50K), so it's nice for checking progress on that front.

### Peppy Piñata Party - ShrineBird

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Birds Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Katock

- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Gayol, 3 Peq, and 1 Ralbone
- **Rewards:** 25 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** The pride of defeating Ralbone should be the queen of this quest, but honestly, I think the Peq are more demanding. Still, 25 Shrine Stones is 25 Shrine Stones!

### Prime Party Piñata - ShrineGiant

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Giants Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Takra
- **Rewards:** 25 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** Easiest quest in this bunch, hands-down. Plus, piñata.

### Seeing a Sequence - ShrineGO

  - 1 Giant Ooze
  - 2 Giant Ooze Houses
  - 3 Wavi Ooze

### The Shrine-Stone Trail - ShrineGiant

- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Tambo Mane https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;644-tambo-mane-3765-86009.png
- **Recommendations:** This monster is intimdating for low-output writers, but it's honestly not that bad. If you have >+21 Attack and >+15 Defense, it's less than 1K/day in actuality. If that's still too gruelling, write offsite and paste in. And if you're a high-output writer, glory in the great loot of the Caravan.

### Spooky Scary Supernaturals - ShrineMar

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Marionette Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each: Osemar, Zosimos, Zosimaga, Zosimas, Zosimalus, Balatros, Balatrix, Balatras
- **Rewards:** 50 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** None needed

### Sticks & Stones - ShrineGiant

- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Marionette Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 each: Balatros, Balatrix, Balatras
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Clown Eyes https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;clown&#95;eyes.png
- **Recommendations:** None needed

### Tears and Feathers - ShrineCar

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Carnival Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Halores
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Carnival Mask https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;646-carnival-mask-3781-45288.png
- **Recommendations:** I happen to adore the mask and recommend going for this as a priority. It does have only the one variant, so it's not like there's a chance of getting a different one you like better, but... fun! Also, I like all the Carnival monsters, so fighting 5 Halores is an appealing prospect.

### There She Blows - ShrineGO

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Green Ooze Shrine Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Whaly Ooze

- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 each: 
  - Captain Shin
  - Untu Captain Uo
- **Rewards:** 25 Shrine Stones, Wardrobe x2: Captain Shin Hair https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;shin&#95;hair&#95;blue.png and Shin Earrings https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;shin&#95;earrings.png
- **Recommendations:**  This hair was the first thing I desperately wanted to spend Crystals on when I joined, and these were my first earrings, so I'm quite nostalgic for them. I also have no need for them, and that desperate feeling predates about 95% of the wardrobe options we now have. So it's hard to evaluate whether they're worth 12K battle words - you'll have to decide for yourself.
