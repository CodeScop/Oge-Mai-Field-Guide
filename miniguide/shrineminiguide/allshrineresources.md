LAST UPDATED 22 APR 2021

Here's a summary of everything available in the Shrine of Ages. If I have anything say "outside game", it means that there's more info about that in the game that isn't relevant to the Shrine; you can go check out the regular Oge-Mai Field Guide for more info.

### Abbreviations & Keywords:

- Anywhere: something that can be obtained anywhere in the game (usually related to the global monsters Awa, Vi, Viyu, Viyusa, and Xin)
- Global: same as Anywhere; I switched my preference for terms a few times and never standardized it.
- OG: Outside Game, when I get lazy about typing it
- Shrine, Shrine0 = Shrine of Ages (general)
- ShrineBird = Shrine of Ages Birds event
- ShrineCar = Shrine of Ages Carnival event
- ShrineCO = Shrine of Ages Colorful Ooze event
- ShrineDucks = Shrine of Ages Ducks event
- ShrineFools = Shrine of Ages Fools' event
- ShrineGiant = Shrine of Ages Giants event
- Shrine GO = Shrine of Ages Green Ooze event
- ShrineMar = Shrine of Ages Marionettes event
- ShrineNPC = Shrine of Ages Special Event NPC event
- ShrinePoly = Shrine of Ages Polygon event
- Shrine TFA = Shrine of Ages Terror From Above event
