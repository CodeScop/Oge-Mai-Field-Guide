# Quests - Giants

NOTE: Once you complete a quest, it's removed from these offerings. So if you have completed a quest in a prior event, it won't be available here.

### Sticks & Stones

- **Unlocked by:** Wardrobe: Giants Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Skuppa's Giant Marionette and 5 Untu Golem
- **Rewards:** 25 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** This is the second-easiest quest in this area, and you'll end up with 75 Shrine Stones including the ones you net from battles. Go for it!

### A Colossal Quest

- **Unlocked by:** Wardrobe: Giants Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each:
  - Skuppa's Giant Marionette
  - Giant Dust Spirit
  - Untu Golem
  - Piachi
  - Guardian
  - Takra
  - Caravan
  - Mandias
- **Rewards:** 75 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** Pace yourself. The Untu Golem will be the most challenging if you write onsite - 12 minutes is not much time to write 500 words. The Caravan will be the most endurance-demanding for lower-output writers, although if you have a sufficiently high Defense (like, anything over 16) you'll have 4 days to write 5K words, and if you can scrape >+44 Defense it'll be 5 days.

### Prime Party Piñata

- **Unlocked by:** Wardrobe: Giants Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Takra
- **Rewards:** 25 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** Easiest quest in this bunch, hands-down. Plus, piñata.

### The Shrine-Stone Trail

- **Unlocked by:** Wardrobe: Giants Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Caravans
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Tambo Mane https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;644-tambo-mane-3765-86009.png
- **Recommendations:** This monster is intimdating for low-output writers, but it's honestly not that bad. If you have >+21 Attack and >+15 Defense, it's less than 1K/day in actuality. If that's still too gruelling, write offsite and paste in. And if you're a high-output writer, glory in the great loot of the Caravan.
