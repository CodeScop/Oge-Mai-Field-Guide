**But before we get to the divided notes, let's briefly note the open markets and other open info.**

You don't need a Bracelet to see the Chests & Keys, or to see the Reaction Market, but you will need a Bracelet to see most of the monsters that drop the Shrine Stones that are used as currency in these stores. (What monsters drop Shrine Stones? All of them. At least, "all of them" that aren't the global monsters like Xin jut hanging around because they're everywhere.) And if you want to see anything in the Wardrobe area, you'll need to be equipped.

Any Chest or Key available in the game is available for sale in the Chests & Keys section.

- Wooden Chest & Wooden Key: 25 Shrine Stones each
- Golden Chest & Leafsung Key: 50 Shrine Stones each
- Stone Chest & Stone Key: 75 Shrine Stones each
- River Chest & River Key: 100 Shrine Stones Each
- Bones Chest & Bone Key: 150 Shrine Stones Each

The Reaction Market sells Reactions for 1 Shrine Stone each. Here's what's available as of the opening (and fair warning: I might not keep close track of this as it changes. I assume it will just offer All The Reactions All The Time, but we don't know yet)

## Shrine Open Monster

Motes wasn't around till about a year after the Shrine opened in its current iteration, although his spot in the Lorebook Bestiary was waiting, and I'm so excited to see him that I'm listing him before his quests.

### Motes

- **Unlocked by:** opening Shrine
- **Requirements:** 1000 words
- **Time allowed:** 180 minutes (3 hours)
- **XP:** 100
- **Drops:** 10 Shrine Stones, 17-25 Coins, 1-2 Rope, 1-3 Raw Fabric, 1-2 Raw Stone
- **Quests:** Shrine: Keeper of the Shrine 1/3 (1), Helper of the Shrine 2/3 (2), Guardian of the Shrine 3/3 (3)

## Shrine Open Quests

###Keeper of the Shrine 1/3

- **Unlocked by:** open Shrine of Ages
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Motes
- **Rewards:** 1 Shrine Ticket
- **Recommendations:**  This is the easiest Shrine Ticket left in the game by the time you get here. Are you telling me you don't want Shrine Tickets?

###Helper of the Shrine 2/3

- **Unlocked by:** Shrine Quest Keeper of the Shrine 1/3
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 2 Motes, deliver 15 Desert Stones
- **Rewards:** 2 Shrine Tickets
- **Recommendations:** The last quest had the easiest Shrine Ticket left; this has the easiest two left after that. Fully worth it, in my book. (Even if Desert Stones are pretty in demand in Desert things, at least this is only 15.)

###Guardian of the Shrine 3/3

- **Unlocked by:** Shrine Quest Helper of the Shrine 2/3
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Motes, deliver 25 Desert Stones and 25 River Stones
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Motes Stone Belt https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1501-merchant-stone-belt-10181-25983.png
- **Recommendations:**  This is up to you. People with long memories of when the Shrine was first introduced might wonder whether this belt has any special properties - poking around, I've found none (though I've only done a cursory check).  Do remember that River Stones are both easier to get and more in demand to spend late in the Water Region, especially the Raina Expedition, so possibly avoid doing this quest until you've evaluated how that part of the game affects your choices here.



**And now, on to the Bracelet-specific info! Listed in the order they're listed above: alphabetically.**
