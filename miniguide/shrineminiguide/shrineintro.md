LAST UPDATED 20 APR 2021

Welcome to my first mini-guide! If you're not familiar, I wrote (and try to maintain) the Field Guide to Oge-Mai: https://4thewords.com/read-oge-mai-field-guide-by-kirala

In it, I try to trace all the connections between quests, monsters, resources, and wardrobe in the game - that is, for a quest I'll list out all the monsters and resources you have to fight and rewards you unlock by completing the quest; for a monster I'll list what they cost to battle, what resources they drop, and what quests require them; and for a resource, I'll list where you can get it and what you can use it for. And then I list out all the wardrobe stuff and quests at the end, just to be fair.

Since the Shrine has grown considerably since it was just two or three events, I've decided that the details are better moved into a separate place. I'm going to keep Shrine info in the full summary in the main Guide, and a bit of a mention of what's there regardless of bracelets, but the nitty gritty will be here.

So! On to the Shrine!

The SHRINE OF AGES! This is a weird and wonderful place where time shifts unpredictably. Which is a fancy way of saying that past events are alive here... *if* you know how to look.

It looks pretty empty at first glance: only one unique monster, one quest. You'll need to take a beeline to Town to the **Shrine Bracelets: Stempos or Tickets** section to unlock the potential. Buy yourself a Bracelet for any event(s) that look interesting. You should have received a Shrine Ticket for every time you've leveled up in the game, and by now that should be enough to get you started here. (If you need to purchase Shrine Tickets with Stempos, well, I talk plenty about how to get Stempos in the Gansu recap.)

Now, to transform the Shrine. Go to your Wardrobe section and equip one of the Bracelets.

After you save it, notice how the Wilderness fills up with monsters. The Shrine Quests provide options, and the Wardrobe Rewards section fills up with items to be purchased with Shrine Stones.

Switch Bracelets, and all this changes.

Have at it.

**My Shrine Notes will be mostly divided by Bracelet.** That is to say, I'll discuss resources, monsters, and quests grouped by which Bracelet makes them appear. (It's worth noting that cheaper Bracelets seem to give fewer monsters and quests.) **I also have a Wardrobe section available after all the regular Bracelet sections** to summarize all the Wardrobe available, for anyone who wants to browse (but at the end so it's easy for anyone else to skip).

**Want a preview?** Each Bracelet premiered with a banner listing images of all the monsters and wardrobe items it unlocks. I've saved those banners here: https://github.com/CodeScop/Oge-Mai-Field-Guide/tree/master/bannershrine
