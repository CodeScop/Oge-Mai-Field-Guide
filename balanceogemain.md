## Floating City of Balance Main Quests

### Main Quest 1: Help From A Master

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Floating City of Balance
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 3 Dí Bags
- **Rewards:** 1 Water Mask
- **Recommendations:** I know the Dí Bags seem endless, but this is the last hurrah in the main quest line. Maybe play around in Riza sidequests for a while if this takes too long to grind, or (better yet) explore Raina Expedition and its more-bountiful River Water sources. And once you finish the first few Balance quests, the range of monsters and sidequests available really opens up.

### Main Quest 2: Underwater Training

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 1: Help From A Master
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Puna, 4 Sliv, and 3 Isartu
- **Rewards:** 3 Water Masks & 1 Underwater Torch
- **Recommendations:** This is where you start getting strategic about sidequests. There are a LOT of Battle sidequests in Balance. Heck, if you wanted, you could work on Gone Fishing AND any Puna sidequests you have left from Luciola or Gansu. You could work on River Landwalkers with the Isartu. Just remember that there are a LOT of Battle quests, and you won't be able to drop them from your Questbook and pick them up again. I would not prioritize any of the sidequests that dovetail with this one; unless you expect to be finishing them quickly, you'll have other uses for your quest slots. (OTOH if you're a fast completionist go ahead and save a couple battles by completing these now and getting ahead.)

### Main Quest 3: The Deep Dark

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 2: Underwater Training
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 8 Nuig, 2 Xyplos, and 2 Vezi
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest
- **Recommendations:** This one I *would* look for sidequests that dovetail, because 8 Nuig battles are a pity to use for only one. (Although be warned that if you want to complete every sidequest, there will be more of these ahead that you simply can't double up well.) Also, don't spring for Underwater Torches unless you have to. If your Luck is >17, you'll usually get one back for each one you use in battle. You won't be able to queue Xyplos or Vezi with a single Underwater Torch, but you might be able to fight them all one at a time with the start from the Torch you won from the last quest. (And if you open any River Chests, they'll get you more Underwater Torches. For those who love to queue.)

### Main Quest 4: Potion For A Goddess

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 3: The Deep Dark
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 12 Nuig String, 25 River Grass, 4 Vezi Shell, and 50 Dust
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest
- **Recommendations:** If these requirements are difficult, you probably haven't done enough of the battle sidequests. Go ahead and revel in those a bit. Some involve a fair amount of traveling, but that's just a good reason to put them all together and do them at once. Anyway, there's only one Main Quest left in Balance after this, so you might as well pace yourself.

### Main Quest 5: The Water Calls

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 4: Potion For A Goddess
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat the River Goddess
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest, Lodo as Companion, open Dark Forest Outpost 
- **Recommendations:** WATCH YOUR EQUIPMENT. 5K words in 72 hours? It might be worth shelling out for a Reinforced Steel Helmet and Reinforced Steel Breastplate first.  Put them together with a Steel Mace, a Harpoon, Steel Boots, and a Stone Ring? It'll take 3,847 words in 3 days and 16 hours, 55 minutes (so almost 4 days). Get a Sands Ring instead of a Stone Ring? 3,817 words in 17 hours, 38 minutes. If you want to figure out the best combo of equipment based on what you have, I have a list of everything here:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BxL_absfs8GyIiDwZRXuABNww43UbS1Qh_dJPDMU3Ig/edit#gid=199447042 And remember, while this is a big one for those of us used to less than 1K per day, it's very doable if you give yourself enough time.
