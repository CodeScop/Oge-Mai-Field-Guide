LAST UPDATED 21 APR 2021

And now, all the quests for the Dust Region. As with the Desert and Water, I'm omitting any Main Quests outside this Region, and for non-Dust Quests I'm listing only the name and location. Let's have a quick recap of how this works:

**The Main Quest Highway** is the main questline of the game, the backbone which unlocks everything else. This line, and only this line, will be defined solely by where it is in the sequence; the Route will tell you where it is in that sequence (LF MQ 3 for the third Main Quest in the Luciola Forest sequence, etc)

**The Expedition Trails** branch off of this Main Quest Highway (so does the **Hunt Trail**) at defined locations. The Route will tell you where it branches off the Main Quest Highway (i.e. which Main Quest unlocks the sidequest that unlocks the Expedition/Hunt) and list out all quests on that Trail. So the quest Joining the Hunt, located in Luciola Forest on the Hunt Trail would read "Hunt Trail Route: (available from game open) • **HuntS1 Joining the Hunt** • HuntS1 The Hunt Begins" etc.

**Quest Paths** are basically a questline off to the side, which don't lead anywhere in particular. To save myself space, they'll be allowed to jump off of Expedition Trails as well as Main Quests. So the quest Battle of Merit, which is unlocked by a quest which is unlocked by The Hunt Begins, would look thus: "Quest Path Route: (open via Hunt Trail HuntS1 The Hunt Begins) • HuntS1 A Battle of Wills • **HuntS1 Battle of Merit** • HuntS1 Battle of Constitution • HuntS1 A Battle of Evolution"

**Lone Quests** are quests which are unlocked by something on the Main Quest Highway or a Trail; instead of a Route, these will simply have an "Unlocked by" field.

#Main Quests, in Order of Unlocking

###(Luciola Forest, Mama Tree, Three Points Crossing,Gansu Watering Hole, Riza Rivertown, and Floating City of Balance quests)

### DFO Main Quest 1/Ousting the Outpost

NOTE: To trigger the DFO Main Quests, you will have to pick up the first one as if it were a side quest. After that, they'll behave more normally.

- **Location:** Dark Forest Outpost
- **Main Quest Highway:** DFO MQ1
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Zanthei, 5 Ascre, and 5 Belasi
- **Rewards:** 1 Bone Key
- **Recommendations:** Make sure and pick up any dovetailing sidequests you can.

### DFO Main Quest 2/Rats, Wrong Way!

- **Location:** Dark Forest Outpost
- **Main Quest Highway:** DFO MQ2
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 3 Pickaxes, defeat 10 Takori, 11 Pakkan, and 12 Chu
- **Rewards:** 1 Bones Chest
- **Recommendations:** Remember that Pickaxes are in the Desert Expedition, if you didn't pick them up there the first time. And if you really hate travel, might be a good time to pick up 10 Kapir Tufts against the future.

### DFO Main Quest 3/The Right Way?

- **Location:** Dark Forest Outpost
- **Main Quest Highway:** DFO MQ3
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 15 Ardi Lamps
- **Rewards:** 1 Bone Key
- **Recommendations:** These are just the first 15 Ardi Lamps you'll need in the main questline; go ahead and pick up a full 25 while you're there, to save time. Remember that Ardi Lamps are in the Forest Expedition, in Forward Base. You might need to check out the Travel Directions section of the Guide to figure out how to unlock it if you haven't already. And while you're in the Forest, you might want to pick up the new sidequest that's just popped up in Luciola Forest. (And if you hate travel, DEFINITELY fight enough Kaija in Base Camp to get 20 Saliva Vials.)

### DFO Main Quest 4/Attacking The Darkness

- **Location:** Dark Forest Outpost
- **Main Quest Highway:** DFO MQ4
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 6 Osalyu and 12 Belasi
- **Rewards:** 1 Bones Chest
- **Recommendations:** Now's a good time to work on the Belasi sidequests! That would be Nasty, Dust Air here, and the sidequest that just popped up in Luciola Forest that I recommended you pick up in the last one. Though be forewarned that the Luciola quest requires 10 Nets, which are pretty expensive, and Belasi are pretty cheap to just fight twice if you don't want 10 Nets staring you down indefinitely.

### DFO Main Quest 5/ A Fox Untrusted

- **Location:** Dark Forest Outpost
- **Main Quest Highway:** DFO MQ5
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Dust Wignow, deliver 10 Ardi Lamps
- **Rewards:** 1 Bone Key
- **Recommendations:** Ardi Lamps again! Otherwise, totally straightforward.

### DFO Main Quest 6/ A Fox Untested

- **Location:** Dark Forest Outpost
- **Main Quest Highway:** DFO MQ6
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat Dust Rudakai
- **Rewards:** 1 Bones Chest
- **Recommendations:** If you've done any Steel Boots quests, congrats! You know how to get Fabric Boots! If you've done 3PC's Tailor sidequest, you might have a spare pair on hand! (And if you haven't, now you know where to get one.) Otherwise, you might want to check out mbrennan's Resource Calculation Spreadsheet to keep track of the Leaf Boots and Leafsung Ink you'll need to make Leafsung Boots to make Fabric Boots: https://4thewords.com/forum/thread-return-of-the-resource-calculation-spreadsheet

### DFO Main Quest 7/The True Reason

- **Location:** Dark Forest Outpost
- **Main Quest Highway:** DFO MQ7
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Papple
- **Rewards:** 1 Bone Key
- **Recommendations:** Sweet and straightforward after the last few.

### DFO Main Quest 8/Bound Up In

- **Location:** Dark Forest Outpost
- **Main Quest Highway:** DFO MQ8
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 2 Sacred Feathers, 20 Essence, 20 Saliva Vials, 10 Kapir Tufts, 10 Refined Dust, 10 River Water
- **Rewards:** 1 Bones Chest
- **Recommendations:** And we're back to complex. But apart from the Refined Dust, all the resources are in the earlier game, so my All Resources section should be able to help you find them.

### DFO Main Quest 9/Detect, Chain, Bind

- **Location:** Dark Forest Outpost
- **Main Quest Highway:** DFO MQ9
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat Miclan
- **Rewards:** 1 Bone Key
- **Recommendations:** So, Miclan requires 5 Steel Chains, 3 Pieces of Parchment, and 1 Blue Essence Ink to fight. If you've opened your Bone Chests so far, you should have enough for this. But at least none of these things are difficult to craft if need be. And you have three days to fight him!

### DFO Main Quest 10/A Dogged Search

- **Location:** Dark Forest Outpost
- **Main Quest Highway:** DFO MQ10
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Chaensi and 1 Lycosta
- **Rewards:** 1 Bones Chest
- **Recommendations:** Look! Lower requirements than Miclan! And again pretty straightforward.

### DFO Main Quest 11/To Hound Babu

- **Location:** Dark Forest Outpost
- **Main Quest Highway:** DFO MQ11
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Babu
- **Rewards:** 1 Bones Chest & 1 Bone Key
- **Recommendations:** Fewer requirements than Miclan, better quest rewards, and you get a good doggie!

### DFO Main Quest 12/ Well of Lost Souls

- **Location:** Dark Forest Outpost
- **Main Quest Highway:** DFO MQ12
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 25 Stone Blocks, 15 Reinforced Rope, 15 Sandstone Blocks, 15 Hardwood, and 10 Steel Bars
- **Rewards:** 1 Bones Chest & 1 Bone Key
- **Recommendations:**  Yes, it's a grind. Same as the end of several other regions. But it's a grind you know how to beat. And if you want to go pick up the new sidequest that lets you just battle Babu instead, it'll give you a shiny new Weapon1 with as much Attack as a Steel Mace (previous winner of Attack) and an additional 4 Luck.

### PG Main Quest 1/Then The Bird Said

NOTE: To trigger the PG Main Quests, you will have to pick up the first one as if it were a side quest. After that, they'll behave more normally.

- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Basic Boots Purple Gate https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1285-basic-boots-purple-gate-9102-70235.png
- **Recommendations:** Welcome to the Purple Gate, land of wardrobe rewards galore! There's very little in the way of resource-based gameplay here, so you won't need any guidance on that front; most of the monsters are quite straightforward, as well. So for most of these, my advice will be simple: up to you!

### PG Main Quest 2/A Desolate Path

- **Main Quest Highway:** PG MQ3
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 8 Eninir and 10 Ardid

- **Recommendations:** As with many of the Purple Gate Main Quests, this one opens alongside new sidequests taking advantage of the same monsters the main quest uses. Check them out to double-dip!

### PG Main Quest 5/What Lies Uncovered

- **Recommendations:** As with many of the Purple Gate Main Quests, this one opens alongside new sidequests taking advantage of the same monsters the main quest uses. Check them out to double-dip!

### PG Main Quest 6/A Fearful Path

- **Location:** Purple Gate
- **Main Quest Highway:** PG MQ6
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Infected Golem
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Steel Hands Necklace https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1211-steel-hands-necklace-8585-24205.png
- **Recommendations:** As with many of the Purple Gate Main Quests, this one opens alongside new sidequests taking advantage of the same monsters the main quest uses. Check them out to double-dip!

### PG Main Quest 7/Fighting the Water

- **Location:** Purple Gate
- **Main Quest Highway:** PG MQ7
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Dust Lodo
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Eninir Skeleton Ribs https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1068-ghoul-ribs-bodypaint-7673-91654.png
- **Recommendations:** Fight Dust Lodo as many times as you want before turning this in, because Dust Lodo is going to disappear after you move on.

### PG Main Quest 8/Fighting the Flame

- **Location:** Purple Gate
- **Main Quest Highway:** PG MQ8
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Dust Azadi
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Eninir Skeleton Neck https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1067-ghoul-neck-bodypaint-7671-62882.png
- **Recommendations:** Same for Dust Azadi as Dust Lodo. I'll mention that if I were going to sit around and grind indefinite Bones Chests and Bone Keys, this isn't where I'd do it.

### PG Main Quest 9/Fighting the Mountain

- **Location:** Purple Gate
- **Main Quest Highway:** PG MQ9
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Dust Suwö
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Dust Suwo Mouth https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1060-dust-suwo-mouth-7657-62115.png
- **Recommendations:** Noticing a trend? This still isn't where I'd camp out, but stick around as long as you want Dust Suwö sticking around.

### PG Main Quest 10/A Familiar Fight

- **Location:** Purple Gate
- **Main Quest Highway:** PG MQ10
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Dark Reflection
- **Rewards:** Unlock the Cave, and Wardrobe x2: Dark Hands Avatar https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1072-dark-avatar-hands-7681-26711.png and Dark Avatar Bodypaint https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1071-dark-avatar-bodypaint-7679-20341.png 
- **Recommendations:** Okay, last boss fight for the Purple Gate. And again, this will disappear once you turn it in. I'm not going to hearken back to the Dust Witch in Gansu and recommend you stick around indefinitely, because there are better places to camp later in the game (yes, there is a "later in the game" even as of the day Purple Gate dropped), but certainly feel free to stick around till you tire of battling your reflection.

### CAVE Main Quest 1/Meet the Shadow

- **Location:** Cave
- **Main Quest Highway:** CAVE MQ1
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 2 Sakot, 5 Vafire, and 3 Gliva
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Basic Boots Cave https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1284-basic-boots-cave-9100-78037.png 
- **Recommendations:** Remember how a lot of my Purple Gate recommendations were copy/paste, because the quests were so self-explanatory? Yeah, same applies for a lot of these. Keep an eye out for overlapping sidequests, and approach as you please.

### CAVE Main Quest 2/Talk with Shadow

- **Location:** Cave
- **Main Quest Highway:** CAVE MQ2
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Attwo, 8 Tacin, and 12 Chio
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Basic Pants Cave https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1288-basic-pants-cave-9108-51968.png
- **Recommendations:** Keep an eye out for overlapping sidequests, and approach as you please.

### CAVE Main Quest 3/Sharpening Stubborn Stones

- **Location:** Cave
- **Main Quest Highway:** CAVE MQ3
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Ghost Suwö
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Smoke Eye Makeup https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1181-smoke-eye-makeup-8273-63331.png
- **Recommendations:** I'll tell you three important things about Ghost Suwö: 1) he is easily the easiest balanced source of Bones Chests/ Bone Keys in the entire game, 2) he disappears after this quest, but 3) he is far from your last chance to do this (unlike the Dust Witch and her Stone Chests and Stempos). Plan your time to turn in this quest accordingly.

### CAVE Main Quest 4/Discuss with Shadow

- **Location:** Cave
- **Main Quest Highway:** CAVE MQ4
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Olanat, 3 Letos, and 3 Gliva
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Mushroom Hair https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1229-mushroom-hair-8621-66729.png
- **Recommendations:** Keep an eye out for overlapping sidequests, and approach as you please.

### CAVE Main Quest 5/It was Like Lightning

- **Location:** Cave
- **Main Quest Highway:** CAVE MQ5
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Ghost Azadi
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Smoke Shoulder Makeup https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1179-smoke-shouldermakeup-8241-75896.png
- **Recommendations:** You can guess where this is going, right? Pattern inverting Purple Gate monsters, certain predictability? Notice that the Ghosts are getting progressively easier, where the Dust-infected companions got harder (but drops are inverting, too).

### CAVE Main Quest 6/Speak with Shadow

- **Location:** Cave
- **Main Quest Highway:** CAVE MQ6
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Spina and 5 Ulos
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Basic Shirt Cave https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1289-basic-shirt-cave-9110-94571.png
- **Recommendations:** Keep an eye out for overlapping sidequests, and approach as you please.

### CAVE Main Quest 7/Dam the Guilt

- **Location:** Cave
- **Main Quest Highway:** CAVE MQ7
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Ghost Lodo
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Cave Eyes https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1226-cave-eyes-8615-13259.png
- **Recommendations:** I will admit that the 500-word guaranteed Bones Chest drop is quite tempting, but if you keep on going, you can have (more expensive) Keys to match.

### CAVE Main Quest 8/The Final Fight

- **Location:** Cave
- **Main Quest Highway:** CAVE MQ8
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Reflection
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Translucid Chest https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1277-translucid-chest-8970-17166.png
- **Recommendations:** Guess what? REFLECTION STAYS. (And the crowds rejoiced!) You do NOT have to worry about milking them to the last drop. In fact, once you turn in this quest, you'll unlock a sidequest fighting Reflections, so don't fight more than one before turning this in.

- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Dark Forest Shoulder Pads https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;darkforest&#95;shoulders.png

Which require a LOT of resources from all over the game. Good luck!

- **Recommendations:** Obviously a long-term commitment, and obviously a wardrobe reward. If you need to grind for the resources to fight these monsters, Zanthei are practically Piece of Parchment farms with enough Refined Dust to help make Blue Essence Ink, and the act of fighting these monsters gives you all the Steel you'll need for Steel Chains.

### Dark Floating Materials (5/5) - Balance

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Quest Path:** (open via DFO MQ12/Well of Lost Souls) • LF Dark Luciola Materials (1/5) • MT Dark Tree Materials (2/5) • 3PC Dark Three Materials (3/5) • Dark Watering Materials (4/5) (Gansu quest) • **Dark Floating Materials (5/5)** 
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 20 Bones, 20 Steel Chains, 15 Refined Dust, and 5 vials Blue Essence Ink
- **Rewards:** 10 Dí Bags and 10 River Water
- **Recommendations:** At this point, I'm a little underwhelmed with the rewards (would have been overjoyed to get them during Riza), but hey. Dust Wignow will get you Refined Dust and Bones, Burhar will get you Steel Chains, and hopefully you can manage the rest.

### Dark Luciola Materials (1/5) - LF

- **Location:** Luciola Forest

- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 15 Bones, 20 Rat Tail, 5 Blue Essence Ink
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest, 1 Wooden Key
- **Recommendations:** This quest chain is worth examining, but it's more of a long-term goal than a quick one. It's also distributed, with each quest picked up in a different area. Go ahead and look through the whole Dark [X] Materials quest chain to see what you like. Skull boots for your Wardrobe? Leafsung Keys? Dí Bags? Is it worth the Dark Forest Outpost stuff? Don't forget that Rat Tails are a side effect of working on the Pit of Nightmares quest!

### Dark Three Materials (3/5) - 3PC

- **Location:** Three Points Crossing
- **Quest Path:** (open via DFO MQ12/Well of Lost Souls) • LF Dark Luciola Materials (1/5) • MT Dark Tree Materials (2/5) • **Dark Three Materials (3/5)** • Dark Watering Materials (4/5) (Gansu quest) • Dark Floating Materials (5/5) (Balance quest)

- **Requirements:** Deliver 30 Steel Chains, 30 Rat Tails, 30 Refined Dust, 30 Pieces of Parchment, 30 Bones
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Dark Forest Boots https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;featured&#95;darkforest&#95;boots.png

### Dark Tree Materials (2/5) - MT

- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 20 Bones, 10 Blue Essence, 15 Refined Dust, 20 Pieces of Parchment, 50 Rat Tails
- **Rewards:** 5 Leafsung Keys
- **Recommendations:** Same as I said for Dark Luciola Materials. I'm always overstocked on Golden Chests and understocked on Leafsung Keys, so this is heaven for me.

### Dark Watering Materials (4/5) - Gansu

- **Quest Path:** (open via DFO MQ12/Well of Lost Souls) • LF Dark Luciola Materials (1/5) • MT Dark Tree Materials (2/5) • 3PC Dark Three Materials (3/5) • **Dark Watering Materials (4/5)**  • Dark Floating Materials (5/5) (Balance quest)
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 20 Vials Blue Essence Ink
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest, 1 Leafsung Key, 1 White Fur
- **Recommendations:** Obviously you'll have to come back to the Desert to spend this reward, but 3PC is lovely this time of year. You might need to gather Glass Bars before you head back to Gansu, and consider getting enough for 25 rather than just 20 Blue Essence Ink.

- **Quest Path:** (open via Hunt Trail HuntS3 A Bubble Dream) • HuntS4 Sing Your Enthusiasm • **Sing Your Bravery 2/2** • HuntS4 Sing Your Commitment 3/4 • HuntS4 Sing Your Wander 4/4
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Cursed Hands

- **Recommendations:** As of this writing (quest has just been released), this is still the last quest in this chain and I don't know whether the chain will be worth any more than its obvious merits. Make your choices!

###Sing Your Commitment (3/4) - HuntS4

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Quest Path:** (open via Hunt Trail HuntS3 A Bubble Dream) • HuntS4 Sing Your Enthusiasm • HuntS4 Sing Your Bravery 2/2 • **Sing Your Commitment 3/4** • HuntS4 Sing Your Wander 4/4

- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Zanthei
- **Rewards:** 20 Hunter Tokens

###Sing Your Wander (4/4) - HuntS4

- **Location:** Elder Library

- **Recommendations:**  See what else you can get going for you while you're on this one. It involves a fair amount of travel, although 160 Coins will pay for you to make a one-way trip across the Valley, and 320 will pay for a round trip, so this might be worth shelling out for.
