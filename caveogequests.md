- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Basic Boots Cave https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1284-basic-boots-cave-9100-78037.png 
- **Recommendations:** Remember how a lot of my Purple Gate recommendations were copy/paste, because the quests were so self-explanatory? Yeah, same applies for a lot of these. Keep an eye out for overlapping sidequests, and approach as you please.

### Main Quest 2/Talk with Shadow

- **Unlocked by:** CAVE MQ 1/Meet the Shadow
- **Type:** Battle

- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Smoke Eye Makeup https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1181-smoke-eye-makeup-8273-63331.png
- **Recommendations:** I'll tell you three important things about Ghost Suwö: 1) he is easily the easiest balanced source of Bones Chests/ Bone Keys in the entire game, 2) he disappears after this quest, but 3) he is far from your last chance to do this (unlike the Dust Witch and her Stone Chests and Stempos). Plan your time to turn in this quest accordingly.

### Main Quest 4/Discuss with Shadow

- **Location:** Cave
- **Unlocked by:** CAVE MQ 3/Sharpening Stubborn Stones
- **Type:** Battle

- **Recommendations:** You can guess where this is going, right? Pattern inverting Purple Gate monsters, certain predictability? Notice that the Ghosts are getting progressively easier, where the Dust-infected companions got harder (but drops are inverting, too).

### Main Quest 6/Speak with Shadow

- **Location:** Cave
- **Unlocked by:** CAVE MQ 5/It was Like Lightning
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Spina and 5 Ulos

- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Cave Eyes https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1226-cave-eyes-8615-13259.png
- **Recommendations:** I will admit that the 500-word guaranteed Bones Chest drop is quite tempting, but if you keep on going, you can have (more expensive) Keys to match.

### Main Quest 8/The Final Fight

- **Location:** Cave
- **Unlocked by:** CAVE MQ 7/Dam the Guilt
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Reflection
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Translucid Chest https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1277-translucid-chest-8970-17166.png
- **Recommendations:** Guess what? REFLECTION STAYS. (And the crowds rejoiced!) You do NOT have to worry about milking them to the last drop. In fact, once you turn in this quest, you'll unlock a sidequest fighting Reflections, so don't fight more than one before turning this in.
