### Main Quest 1: Earthquakes

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Three Points Crossing
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Yasri, 3 Kiru, 1 Lombri, and 1 Bruja
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest
- **Recommendations:** You'll need a Wood Spear to spend on the Lombri battle; they come relatively cheap if you head back to Mama Tree and open a Wooden Chest. (And it's never too early to start collecting Vine Nets from those chests if you want to complete all sidequests in the game.) Take your time with these, explore, and consider which sidequests you value. 3PC is much more intense, generally, than prior regions. Also, most of the quests are collection-oriented. It never hurts to stock up on textiles, Xin/Awa drops, and steel. ALSO: Do NOT use or sell any Raw Fabric, Fine Fabric, or Red Dye received in drops during this quest until you finish Main Quest 3.

### Main Quest 2: Just Another Brick

- **Unlocked by:** 3PC Main Quest 1/Earthquakes
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 8 Stone, 30 Wood, 4 Steel, and 10 Rope
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest
- **Recommendations:** Shouldn't take too long, especially if you notice that Rulo drop full-fledged Stone Blocks without you needing to craft them. If, like me, you tend to run low on Wood, remember that it's always better to grind Xin or head to the Forest before you seek other options. 

### Main Quest 3: Camouflage

- **Unlocked by:** 3PC Main Quest 2/Just Another Brick
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Get 6 Fine Fabric, 10 Raw Fabric, and 4 Red Dye
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Desert Facemask
- **Recommendations:** I hope you saved your drops from the first quest, because if you did, you probably have at least most of what you need already. Otherwise, I recommend fighting Yasri; they're a source of all the materials you need, and 6 Yasri battles should cover all your bases. You could also fight Bruja for Red Dye, Frizi for Raw Fabric, and Desert Wignow for Essence to get all you need to craft Fine Fabric instead, but that's far more time-consuming; I'd only do that if 900-word Bruja are THAT MUCH more appealing than 1250-word Yasri.

### Main Quest 4: A Desert Army

- **Unlocked by:** 3PC Main Quest 3/Camouflage
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Fight 5 Assassins
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest
- **Recommendations:** They're Assassins. Exactly the same as Mama Tree. (In fact, if you went back to Mama Tree and fought Assassins there, it would count the same.) Assassins will disappear from Three Points Crossing once you deliver this quest, so if (like me) you like milking Assassins for Wooden Keys, it might be worth fighting a few extra while they're around before delivering the quest. (Also, the Steel Daggers they drop will be useful in the next region; you'll probably want at least a dozen.)

### Main Quest 5: A Way South

- **Unlocked by:** 3PC Main Quest 4/A Desert Army
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Get 20 Wood, 10 Rope, 20 Leaves, 5 Raw Fabric, 1000 Coins, Min Level 10
- **Rewards:** Gansu Watering Hole & Azadi as Companion
- **Recommendations:** Most of these materials are simple: "fight Xin and Awa". And while you're fighting Xin, sell River Grass like there's no tomorrow. (We're approaching the time when you'll need River Grass, same as you've discovered uses for Raw Fabric, but it's still pretty safe to sell down to zero.) This is a good time to skim through the various sidequests and figure out what else you might want to collect at the same time.
