Remember, to see the following, your avatar needs to be wearing the Polygon Time Bracelet, which can be purchased for 3 Shrine Tickets in the Shrine Bracelets area.

# Quests - Polygon

NOTE: Once you complete a quest, it's removed from these offerings. So if you have completed a quest in a prior event, it won't be available here.

ALSO, I will be skipping recommendations for all but one of these, since I really don't see where they would be necessary.
