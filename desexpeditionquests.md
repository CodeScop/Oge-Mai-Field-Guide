# DIG SITE QUESTS

### Question to Axe

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Dig Site
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Craft 3 Pickaxe to deliver
- **Rewards:** Unlock Ruins area

### Birbs of a Feather

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Dig Site
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 15 Rif
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest
- **Recommendations:** STONE CHEST. DO. (Just bear in mind that it pairs well with an Underground Ruins quest, so you might want to be in Ruins first.)

### Bounding Over Dunes

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Dig Site
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 6 Bevrex
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest & 1 Stone Key
- **Recommendations:** WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME. 1800 words for a Stone Chest AND a Stone Key? DOOO IT. (Possibly alongside another quest in Ruins. You'll see.)

### Dazzling Desert Colors

- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Zera, 1 Suulan, and 1 Arenica
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Zera Fur Necklace https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1123-zera-fur-necklace-8039-94110.png
- **Recommendations:** I find that necklace pretty irresistible, but YMMV. I also have a weakness for battling the pretty creatures.

### A Desert Exploration

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Dig Site
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Kapir
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Tiny Boots
- **Recommendations:** You're going to want to have fought one Kapir sooner or later; why not five? And such stylish boots!

### From Beneath Me

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Dig Site
- **Type:** Streak, Collection
- **Requirements:** Maintain a 3-day streak AFTER picking up the quest, deliver 15 Rope
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Key
- **Recommendations:** A Stone Key for some Rope and time? Hot diggity! Especially if you just got a Stone Chest fighting Kapir.

### Khaki Twisting Beige

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Dig Site
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Sakish & 3 Okkorhi
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest & 1 Stone Key
- **Recommendations:** It's nice to have a use for Sakish and Okkorhi, and it's nice to have a source for Stone Chests and Keys. Nice all around.

### A Squirming Nest

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Dig Site
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 100 Loi
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Lombri Hat https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1033-lombri-hat-7567-63630.png
- **Recommendations:** Well, it's not a priority for me because I prefer shorter to-do lists even if they're large chunks, but it would be nice to just set Loi on an infinity loop for a while and see how much of this gets knocked out.

# RUINS QUESTS

NOTE: The Ruins quests can be summarized as "make sure you pick up the four North, South, East, West quests right away, then fight one each of the unique Ruins monsters to fulfill them, then take the crowning one". If you want to save time looking at the individual quests.

### Tunnel Locked On

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Ruins opens for visibility, completing PREREQUISITES opens for actually taking the quest
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 3 Kapir Tufts, 3 Spider Poison, and 3 Desert Stones
- **PREREQUISITES:** Navigating North, Searching South, Withdrawing West, Excavating East quests in any order
- **Rewards:** Unlock Shrine of Ages
- **Recommendations:** Want to enter the fun house/ bizarro world of the game? Come on, you know you do! And there are some nice little rewards in here, too.

### Searching South

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Ruins
- **Type:** Words, Battle
- **Requirements:** Write 830 Words, defeat 1 Ripos
- **Rewards:** 5 Raw Gold, progress toward Shrine of Ages
- **Recommendations:** Do it. Ignore the wordcount, you'll get that many words anyway fighting Ripos. (Actually, might want to make sure you've taken all the other directional quests at the same time, so Ripos takes care of extra wordcount.)

### Navigating North

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Ruins
- **Type:** Words, Battle
- **Requirements:** Write 750 Words, defeat 1 Yantao
- **Rewards:** 5 Raw Steel, progress toward Shrine of Ages
- **Recommendations:** Do it! Make sure you have the other directional quests at the same time, so you're not duplicating effort on wordcount.

### Withdrawing West

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Ruins
- **Type:** Words, Battle
- **Requirements:** Write 670 words, defeat 1 Griffe
- **Rewards:** 5 Raw Sandstone
- **Recommendations:** Do it! Make sure you have the other directional quests at the same time, so you're not duplicating effort on wordcount.

### Excavating East

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Ruins
- **Type:** Words, Battle
- **Requirements:** Write 450 words, defeat 1 Gordi
- **Rewards:** 5 Raw Stone
- **Recommendations:** Do it! Make sure you have the other directional quests at the same time, so you're not duplicating effort on wordcount.

### Gordi & Griffe Gather

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Underground Ruins
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 25 Gordi & 5 Griffe
- **Rewards:** 5 Stone Blocks, 5 Sandstone Blocks, 3 Raw Gold
- **Recommendations:** I have a sneaking suspicion those rewards will look a lot more generous when we have houses. Meanwhile, it's up to you if it's worth it!

### Full of Surprises!

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Underground Ruins
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Ripos
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest & 1 Stone Key
- **Recommendations:** I'm just not into turning down those Stone Chests and Stone Keys. And Ripos *are* a source of valuable Spider Poison and Desert Stones, even if not the best source.

### Feathers & Fur

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Underground Ruins
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Bevrex and 5 Rif
- **Rewards:** 3 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** Did you wait on the Birbs of a Feather and Bounding Over Dunes in Dig Site? Because if you have this in you Questbook, it'll automatically finish while you do the other two. If not, it's still a fairly easy way to get 3 Stempos.

### Every Tunnel Connects

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Underground Ruins
- **Type:** Streak
- **Requirements:** Get a 10-day Streak
- **Rewards:** 4 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** I'm getting this for the easy Stempos. And the suspicion that this might unlock something else later...
