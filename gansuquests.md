## Gansu Watering Hole Main Quests

### Main Quest 1: Circle of Protection

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Gansu Watering Hole
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Wetu and 2 Rulo, and collect 15 Desert Stones
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest
- **Recommendations:** It won't hurt to collect a whole lot more Desert Stones than that. Desert Wignow will be your best source if you don't already have enough on hand.

### Main Quest 2: Lorsa Nest Network

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 1/Circle of Protection
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect/Craft 1 Lorsa Nest
- **Rewards:** 100 Coins
- **Recommendations:** Good news! This is the last time you'll be required to build a Lorsa Nest in the game (though there are some sidequests that require it). Bad news: if you don't already have enough Claws to build this, you'll have to head back to the Forest to get them. Make sure you're stocked up on Reenu Wings while you're there; you'll be needing half a dozen later.

### Main Quest 3: Sacred Shrine

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 2/Lorsa Nest Network
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Get 10 Stone Blocks, 5 Sandstone Blocks, 5 Desert Stone, 1 White Fur, and 1 Sacred Feather
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest
- **Recommendations:** Now we're cooking! Suulan and Arenica are now available to fight. If you're low on Steel Daggers to fight them, consider going back to the Forest and fighting Assassins for them, though they're always available in the 3PC Item Bazaar also. You'll probably be spending some time there crafting Sandstone Blocks, too. This is a good time to get a lot of side quests done and dally a bit.

### Main Quest 4: The Welcoming Committee

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 3/Sacred Shrine
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Lombri, 2 Yasri, 2 Kiru, and 2 Bruja
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest
- **Recommendations:** With all these Stone Chests, I hope you've been doing the Weekly Global Quests for Stone Keys! You know the routine by now.

### Main Quest 5: White Stars' Light

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 4/The Welcoming Committee
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 3 White Fur
- **Rewards:** 100 Coins
- **Recommendations:** Obviously this will be Suulan battles, probably two of them. Do as you will.

### Main Quest 6: Waters of History

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 5/White Stars' Light
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Kiru and 3 Bruja
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest
- **Recommendations:** This is the last quest before the two-part finale (wow, who knew there could be so many Main Quests, right?) Good time to take stock and consider how many sidequests you'd like to cross off now.

### Main Quest 7: Red Witch of the Southern Coven

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 6/Waters of History
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat the Red Witch (4000 words in 1000 minutes)
- **Rewards:** 1 Stempo
- **Recommendations:** You'll need a Stempo for the next quest, so don't lose or sell this one if it's your only one. Also: when you get to the next quest, READ MY RECOMMENDATION BEFORE COMPLETING.

### Main Quest 8: Dust to Dust

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 7/Red Witch of the Southern Coven
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat the Dust Witch (1 Stempo and 1200 words in 400 minutes)
- **Rewards:** Open Riza Rivertown, Stone of Air
- **Recommendations:** DO NOT DELIVER THIS QUEST… until you've fought the Dust Witch as many times as you can.
  Because the Dust Witch will only stick around as long as this quest is in play. And 1200 words in 400 minutes (three words per minute! c'mon!) will give you *three* Stempos in return for the one you paid, on top of a Golden Chest AND a Stone Chest. (Apart from this, there are only 14 Stone Chests in the entire game. This is the ONLY PLACE you can get an indefinite number.) Sure, you won't be able to open them until you get the Stone Keys one slow week at a time (although there are more Stone Key quests ahead), but it's worth the investment. Plus, those Protective Mantles you can sell for cash at the time being.

## Gansu Watering Hole Sidequests

LAST UPDATED 26 MAR 2020

If there's an asterisk, it unlocked in the process of going through this region.

### Battle Experience

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Gansu Watering Hole
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Win 100 Battles Against Any Monster
- **Rewards:** 1 Protective Cloak & 2 Protective Mantles
- **Recommendations:** Might as well pick it up if you have a space open (you'll be fighting battles regardless), but it's no longer useful the way it used to be.

### Desert Rudakai

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Gansu Watering Hole
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 15 Desert Rudakai
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest & 1 Stone Key
- **Recommendations:** This is a no-brainer YES for me, bc Desert Rudakai are some of my favorites. More objectively, there is a sidequest at the end of the game that also involves 3 Desert Rudakai and it might be nice to postpone this if this involves more Desert Rudakai than you like. Still, it's a good cost/benefit ratio even now, if you have decent stocks of Leaf Boots and Leaves on hand. (I'm fighting a Desert Rudakai writing this. <3 )

### Sacred Feathers

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Gansu Watering Hole
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 10 Sacred Feathers
- **Rewards:** 3 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** If you're seeing this when you first get to Gansu and wondering how you do it, Step 1 is "get to the third Main Quest in Gansu". That's what makes Arenica available. Once you have that, this is exactly as valuable as Stempos are to you. How likely is it that you'll need to reserve days off for your streak, or make up a missed day? Is it worth 5 Steel Daggers and 6750 words (reduced by howevermuch your Attack is)? If so, go for it! Otherwise, it'll keep.

### Snake Pit

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Gansu Watering Hole
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 25 Ylly
- **Rewards:** 5 Gold Bars
- **Recommendations:** Do it whenever you have a chance, if you like long sidequests at all. The Gold Bars are a lackluster prize, but at least it's *some* extra prize while you earn Ylly's drops, which are invaluable in later quests.

### Stone Collector

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Gansu Watering Hole
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 100 Desert Stones
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest & 1 Stone Key
- **Recommendations:** If this will be quick, or you like hunting Desert Stones, go for it! Be aware, though, that there are a LOT of Desert Stone requirements in both main and sidequests for a while, and you might want to wait on spending what you have. (And there's an easier sidequest with the same rewards if you wait a bit.)

### Tougher With Tambo

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Gansu Watering Hole
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 250 Wood, 100 Rope, 25 Stone
- **Rewards:** 3 Stone Chests and 3 Stone Keys
- **Recommendations:** These are great rewards, but you'll be wanting a lot of Wood, Rope, and Stone Blocks for a series of quests unlocked at the end of Gansu. Consider waiting on this one till you finish Riza Rivertown if grinding bugs you.

### Watering Hole Puna

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Gansu Watering Hole
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Puna
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Key
- **Recommendations:** Do it. Immediately. A Stone Key for 1500 words and 10 Wooden Fishing Rods? Cheap!

### ** Gansu Watering Hole Puffs

- **Unlocked by:** Watering Hole Puna
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Furoxi
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest
- **Recommendations:** DOOO IIIIIITTTT. Such great rewards for so little (relative) work!

### White Coat

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Gansu Watering Hole
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 10 White Fur
- **Rewards:** 3 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** Same as with Sacred Feathers, if you're seeing this when you first get to Gansu and wondering how you do it, Step 1 is "get to the third Main Quest in Gansu". That's what makes Suulan available. They're very reliable about dropping White Fur, so you'll need a fairly predictable 5 Steel Daggers and 10,000 words to beat this quest, but I'd save it till after you're done with the rest of Gansu and its various White Fur needs. (Also, be aware that coming back to this after you reach the Dust Region will give you more options, although they're neither better nor worse.)

### ** Digging Into Desert Sands

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 8/Dust To Dust
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Wetu, be Min Level 8
- **Rewards:** Open Dig Site
- **Recommendations:** DO IT. So worth it. Expedition is always fun.

### ** Protect the Body

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 8/Dust To Dust
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 50 Desert Stones
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest & 1 Stone Key
- **Recommendations:** This is the "easier than Stone Collector" quest I was talking about: 50 Desert Stones for a Stone Chest and Stone Key. Do it! (Unless you really, really hate collecting Desert Stones and need to save what you have.)

### ** Protect the Mind

- **Unlocked by:** Protect the Body
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 100 Desert Stones
- **Rewards:** 5 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** Having fun collecting Desert Stones yet? If you finish this, you'll unlock another with the same feel! Stempos *are* awfully nice to have, and these are hardly the most expensive in the game. But if you get tired of Desert Stones, there are alternatives.

### ** Protect the Spirit

- **Unlocked by:** Protect the Mind
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 200 Desert Stones
- **Rewards:** 10 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** This is the point where I began hating Desert Stones, but at least it's the last sidequest to demand them in large numbers. You finished Protect the Mind, if you're here. You know what it takes. Decide if it's worth it!

### ** Rebuild the Watering Hole

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 8/Dust To Dust
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Get 50 Raw Fabric, 10 Stone Blocks, and 15 Rope
- **Rewards:** 1 Stempo (and after more quests, ability to craft them)
- **Recommendations:** DO IT. This is the first quest in a path to be able to craft infinite Stempos, and that ability is worth it. (Don't forget that Rulo are a great source of Stone Blocks!)

### ** Respark the Flame

- **Unlocked by:** Rebuild the Watering Hole
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 5 Stone Blocks, 5 Sandstone Blocks, 10 Hardwood, 20 Desert Stone
- **Rewards:** 1 Stempo (and after more quests, ability to craft them)
- **Recommendations:** Again, do it: ability to craft Stempos is worth it, IMHO. If you're wondering what Hardwood is, you probably haven't run over to Riza yet (and you might need to go fight a few Riza battles to get enough), but that's fine. Go play around in the Riza quests and come on back. 

### ** Local Shrine

- **Unlocked by:** Respark the Flame
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Get 5 Sacred Feather and 5 White Fur
- **Rewards:** 1 Stempo (and after 1 more quest, ability to craft them)
- **Recommendations:** Getting so close! Go for it. You'll probably end up with 6 Sacred Feathers and 6 White Furs if you battle for them; SAVE THE EXTRA...

### ** First Stempo

- **Unlocked by:** Local Shrine
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 10 Essence, 1 Glass, 1 Gold, 1 Sacred Feather, 1 White Fur
- **Rewards:** 1 Stempo, and ability to craft them
- **Recommendations:** This is actually exactly what it says on the tin: the first Stempo you craft. These ingredients will reliably get you one Stempo every time after this, when it becomes a craftable item in Crafts & Trinkets/Wynfri of Water. So you can actually postpone this quest till you want more Stempos, if you want, but the sooner you get it out of the way, the sooner you can craft them in batches.

## 3PC Sidequests Unlocked by Gansu

### Double the Rarity

- **Unlocked by:** Gansu Main Quest 8/Dust to Dust
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Get 12 Sacred Feathers and 12 White Fur
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest
- **Recommendations:** Only if you really want to. This almost is more of a "Battle" quest, because the only way to get Sacred Feathers is by battling Arenica, and Suulan is the only source of White Fur till after the Water Region. And unless your Luck is low, you'll get 12 Golden Chests dropped during these battles apart from the quest rewards. The Sacred Feathers and White Fur are more useful to craft Stempos, but hey, mileage varies.

##Mama Tree Sidequests Unlocked by Gansu

### Study Break Time

- **Unlocked by:** First Stempo in Gansu (part of a long chain of Gansu sidequests)
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Pay 10 Stempos
- **Rewards:** 3 Wooden Keys & 3 Wooden Chests
- **Recommendations:** Before Wooden Chests were added to the rewards, my recommendation was as follows: "For completionists only. 10 Stempos are ridiculously more valuable than 3 Wooden Keys, so unless you have dozens on hand you don't expect to use or you're desperate to complete every. single. quest… skip this."
  Now that Wooden Chests have been added, my recommendation is... pretty much the same. It's no longer insanely imbalanced, but the average player will get more use out of 10 Stempos than 3 Wooden Key/Chest pairs. Unless you have 10 Stempos you won't otherwise use, which is possible if you've accumulated a lot.
