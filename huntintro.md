The Hunt for the Ancients is a sidetrack, weaving around the main game. Your progress in the Hunt will be limited by your progress in the main game â€” if you're still limited to Luciola Forest, you won't get more than a few quests in to the Hunt. Meanwhile, if you just want to collect Hunter Tokens from this month's monsters, you can earn Hunt gear perfectly easily.

If you want.

It's not like the Hunt contributes to progress in the main game.

But oh, how fun it is to take a side trail sometimes.

So! The Hunt is releasing content month by month, apparently with each Season of the Hunt focusing on a different Region of the game. 

I'll summarize my recommendations for each Hunt season at the end of its region. So, skip ahead to the Hunt Season 1 section if you want more advice!

A sneak preview, of the first quest that unlocks the Hunt:

### Joining the Hunt

- **Type:** Wordcount/Level
- **Requirements:** Min Level 3, 3000 Words
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens, unlock the Hunt
- **Recommendations:** This is not optional if you want to participate in the Hunt. Might as well get it done immediately! See what other quests you can do while you're generating 3000 words.
