LAST UPDATED 25 JAN 2021

The Hunt for the Ancients is a sidetrack, weaving around the main game. Your progress in the Hunt will be limited by your progress in the main game â€” if you're still limited to Luciola Forest and Mama Tree, you won't get more than a few quests in to the Hunt. Meanwhile, if you just want to collect Hunter Tokens from this month's monsters, you can earn Hunt gear perfectly easily.

If you want.

It's not like the Hunt contributes to progress in the main game.

But oh, how fun it is to take a side trail sometimes.

So! The Hunt is releasing content month by month, apparently with each Season of the Hunt focusing on a different Region of the game. 

I'll summarize my recommendations for each Hunt season in its region. So, skip ahead to the Hunt Season 1 section if you want more advice!

A sneak preview, of the first quest that unlocks the Hunt:

###The Winding Path to Elder Library

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** Opening Mama Tree
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Tylu and 3 Illi
- **Rewards:** Unlock Elder Library; 100 Coins
- **Recommendations:**  This is NOT OPTIONAL; you'll need to complete this quest to access anything else about the Hunt that you don't already have in your possession. The good news: lots of goodies ahead!
