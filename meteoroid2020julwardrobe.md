This event is unusually full of wardrobe in an unusual number of places! There are two wardrobe stores, multiple quest rewards, and even one monster drop. So I'll go through area by area. Links for previews of all wardrobe variations for things outside the storeâ€”for things inside the stores, there are sneak peeks there.
