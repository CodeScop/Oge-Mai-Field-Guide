LAST UPDATED 5 JUL 2020

So, this area has something in common with the Expedition areas: namely, I'm not going to bother naming a single resource that isn't found in this context. If it isn't dropped by an event Monster, or from an event Quest, I'm not including it. 

Also, I'm segregating Event info at the top, and Coins are immediately below since they're not in inventory. (And I'm counting Dinti as Event since it's basically been out of the game between the two Alien Meteor events.) So it's not quite alphabetical. I figure the Event items are what you're looking here for anyway; for other resources, go check out the Resource section in the main game.

AREA ABBREVIATIONS:

- FOREST, DESERT, WATER, DUST = refer to main regions of the regular game; can be ignored for the event unless you want to cross-reference the relevant Resources elsewhere
- All Event = monsters available globally in all regions
- IC = Alien Meteoroid: Impact Crater
- Spaceship = Alien Meteoroid: Spaceship
- MS = Alien Meteoroid: Mining Site
