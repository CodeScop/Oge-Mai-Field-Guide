- **Recommendations:** Welcome to the Purple Gate, land of wardrobe rewards galore! There's very little in the way of resource-based gameplay here, so you won't need any guidance on that front; most of the monsters are quite straightforward, as well. So for most of these, my advice will be simple: up to you!

- **Recommendations:** Same for Dust Azadi as Dust Lodo. I'll mention that if I were going to sit around and grind indefinite Bones Chests and Bone Keys, this isn't where I'd do it.

### Main Quest 10/A Familiar Fight

- **Recommendations:** Okay, last boss fight for the Purple Gate. And again, this will disappear once you turn it in. I'm not going to hearken back to the Dust Witch in Gansu and recommend you stick around indefinitely, because there are better places to camp later in the game (yes, there is a "later in the game" even as of the day Purple Gate dropped), but certainly feel free to stick around till you tire of battling your reflection.
