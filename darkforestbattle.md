LAST UPDATED 2 APR 2020

I'm doing something a little fancier here, to match the final Battle Items list. In the title for each weapon. I'm going to summarize its properties with (Attack, Defense, Luck) and =Total. So Suwö the Companion is (3,7,2) =12. Don't worry, I'm keeping the long form in the Equip line, just wanted to provide a quick browse option. 

Anyway, hopefully this will give you a quick feel for how to max any given stat for what you have access to.

Ω = best total stats for the category

† = best Attack for the category (Feet and Chest have no Attack)

∆ = best Defense for the category

«» = best Luck for the category (Chest has no Luck)
