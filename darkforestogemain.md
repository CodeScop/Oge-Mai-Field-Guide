## Dark Forest Outpost Main Quests

LAST UPDATED 11 FEB 2020

### Main Quest 1/Ousting the Outpost

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Dark Forest Outpost
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Zanthei, 5 Ascre, and 5 Belasi
- **Rewards:** 1 Bone Key
- **Recommendations:** Make sure and pick up any dovetailing sidequests you can.

### Main Quest 2/Rats, Wrong Way!

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 1/Ousting the Outpost
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 3 Pickaxes, defeat 10 Takori, 11 Pakkan, and 12 Chu
- **Rewards:** 1 Bones Chest
- **Recommendations:** Remember that Pickaxes are in the Desert Expedition, if you didn't pick them up there the first time. And if you really hate travel, might be a good time to pick up 10 Kapir Tufts against the future.

### Main Quest 3/The Right Way?

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 2/Rats, Wrong Way!
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 15 Ardi Lamps
- **Rewards:** 1 Bone Key
- **Recommendations:** These are just the first 15 Ardi Lamps you'll need in the main questline; go ahead and pick up a full 25 while you're there, to save time. Remember that Ardi Lamps are in the Forest Expedition, in Forward Base. You might need to check out the Travel Directions section of the Guide to figure out how to unlock it if you haven't already. And while you're in the Forest, you might want to pick up the new sidequest that's just popped up in Luciola Forest. (And if you hate travel, DEFINITELY fight enough Kaija in Base Camp to get 20 Saliva Vials.)

### Main Quest 4/Attacking The Darkness

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 3/The Right Way?
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 6 Osalyu and 12 Belasi
- **Rewards:** 1 Bones Chest
- **Recommendations:** Now's a good time to work on the Belasi sidequests! That would be Nasty, Dust Air here, and the sidequest that just popped up in Luciola Forest that I recommended you pick up in the last one. Though be forewarned that the Luciola quest requires 10 Nets, which are pretty expensive, and Belasi are pretty cheap to just fight twice if you don't want 10 Nets staring you down indefinitely.

### Main Quest 5/ A Fox Untrusted

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 4/Attacking The Darkness
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Dust Wignow, deliver 10 Ardi Lamps
- **Rewards:** 1 Bone Key
- **Recommendations:** Ardi Lamps again! Otherwise, totally straightforward.

### Main Quest 6/ A Fox Untested

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 5/A Fox Untrusted
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat Dust Rudakai
- **Rewards:** 1 Bones Chest
- **Recommendations:** If you've done any Steel Boots quests, congrats! You know how to get Fabric Boots! If you've done 3PC's Tailor sidequest, you might have a spare pair on hand! (And if you haven't, now you know where to get one.) Otherwise, you might want to check out mbrennan's Resource Calculation Spreadsheet to keep track of the Leaf Boots and Leafsung Ink you'll need to make Leafsung Boots to make Fabric Boots: https://4thewords.com/forum/thread-return-of-the-resource-calculation-spreadsheet

### Main Quest 7/The True Reason

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 6/A Fox Untested
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Papple
- **Rewards:** 1 Bone Key
- **Recommendations:** Sweet and straightforward after the last few.

### Main Quest 8/Bound Up In

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 7/The True Reason
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 2 Sacred Feathers, 20 Essence, 20 Saliva Vials, 10 Kapir Tufts, 10 Refined Dust, 10 River Water
- **Rewards:** 1 Bones Chest
- **Recommendations:** And we're back to complex. But apart from the Refined Dust, all the resources are in the earlier game, so my All Resources section should be able to help you find them.

### Main Quest 9/Detect, Chain, Bind

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 8/Bound Up In
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat Miclan
- **Rewards:** 1 Bone Key
- **Recommendations:** So, Miclan requires 5 Steel Chains, 3 Pieces of Parchment, and 1 Blue Essence Ink to fight. If you've opened your Bone Chests so far, you should have enough for this. But at least none of these things are difficult to craft if need be. And you have three days to fight him!

### Main Quest 10/A Dogged Search

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 9/Detect, Chain, Bind
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Chaensi and 1 Lycosta
- **Rewards:** 1 Bones Chest
- **Recommendations:** Look! Lower requirements than Miclan! And again pretty straightforward.

### Main Quest 11/To Hound Babu

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 10/A Dogged Search
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Babu
- **Rewards:** 1 Bones Chest & 1 Bone Key
- **Recommendations:** Fewer requirements than Miclan, better quest rewards, and you get a good doggie!

### Main Quest 12/ Well of Lost Souls

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 11/To Hound Babu
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 25 Stone Blocks, 15 Reinforced Rope, 15 Sandstone Blocks, 15 Hardwood, and 10 Steel Bars
- **Rewards:** 1 Bones Chest & 1 Bone Key
- **Recommendations:**  Yes, it's a grind. Same as the end of several other regions. But it's a grind you know how to beat. And if you want to go pick up the new sidequest that lets you just battle Babu instead, it'll give you a shiny new Weapon1 with as much Attack as a Steel Mace (previous winner of Attack) and an additional 4 Luck.
