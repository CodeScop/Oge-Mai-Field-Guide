  - 3 Reenu Wings
  - 2 Spider Poison
  - 3 Nuig String

- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Drill Bracelet https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1092-drill-bracelet-7908-26970.png
- **Recommendations:** This is A Lot for a relatively small reward.  The items range from Luciola Forest (Reenu Wings) to Dark Forest Outpost (Bones) with a sidestep into Desert Expedition (Kapir Tuft). So it's mostly a matter of pride to deliver, and a use for items you might happen to accumulate as you close out the main quest sequence. (At least the Drill Bracelet comes in Left, Right, and Both Wrists?)

### Projecting Light

NOTE: This exact quest was offered during the Alien Meteoroid Expedition in July 2020; if you completed it then, it will not be available now.

- **Location:** Research Lab
- **Unlocked by:** Opening Research Lab
- **Type:** Battle

- **Recommendations:** No hurries, but... why not? This is a fun one. Note that it's UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE until you've completed the Biodome sequence starting with Set Creatures Free! (1/4) and then quests to unlock each of the individual monsters involved (so 8 quests total).

### Set Creatures Free! (1/4)

- **Location:** Research Lab
- **Unlocked by:** Opening Research Lab
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Captain Piak, 1 Dr. Enoe, 1 Dr. Hogglevoss, and 1 Rosarin
- **Rewards:** 5 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** This quest can't really be evaluated on its own, because it's all about the whole sequence. And I find the whole sequence rewarding, if challenging. It isn't possible to complete and get the ultimate reward until you're halfway through the Floating City of Balance in Oge-Mai, but why not give it a whirl?

### Create a Clearing (2/4)

- **Type:** Battle

- **Recommendations:** There are a lot of quests here that need no extra recommendations, so here's a boilerplate to say this is one of them. :)

### Build a Biodome (3/4)

- **Location:** Research Lab
- **Unlocked by:** Create a Clearing (2/4)
- **Type:** Collection, Streak
- **Requirements:** 3-day Streak, and deliver 15 Steel Bars, 15 Glass Bars, and 15 Stone Blocks
- **Rewards:** 5 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** There are a lot of quests here that need no extra recommendations, so here's a boilerplate to say this is one of them. :)

### Encourage an Ecosystem (4/4)

- **Location:** Research Lab
- **Unlocked by:** Build a Biodome (3/4)
- **Type:** Collection, Streak
- **Requirements:** 15-day Streak, and deliver: 
  - 5 Lorsa Fur - found in Mama Tree
  - 15 Raw Fabric
  - 10 Rope
  - 20 River Grass

  - 5 Dinti
  - 5 Saliva Vials - Base Camp
  - 5 Feathers - easiest to find in the Forest Region
- **Rewards:** none listed; unlocking quests to unlock experimental monsters (and 1 Coin, per experimental results)
- **Recommendations:** That is a long shopping list. I hope you can find Dinti without my labeling it (you're IN the Alien Meteoroid Expedition after all), and many of the items are very common, but I've added locations to find the more obscure resources.

### Making Mellow Mowow

- **Location:** Research Lab
- **Unlocked by:** RL Quest Encourage an Ecosystem 4/4
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 15 Dinti, 15 Leaves, 5 Stone Blocks, and 3 Essence
- **Rewards:** 1 Stempo, unlock Mowow
- **Recommendations:** There are a lot of quests here that need no extra recommendations, so here's a boilerplate to say this is one of them. :)

- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 10 Fine Fabric, 5 Fur, and 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Rewards:** 1 Stempo, unlock Sabu

### Silkly Sleek Sulanica

- **Location:** Research Lab
- **Unlocked by:** RL Quest Encourage an Ecosystem 4/4
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 3 White Fur, 3 Sacred Feather, 5 Raw Fabric, and 10 Glass Shards
- **Rewards:** 1 Stempo, unlock Sulanica
- **Recommendations:** The process of gathering 3 White Fur and 3 Sacred Feathers should remind you how useful it could be to have a monster that consistently drops both for only a thousand words. Invaluable for Stempo production, once you've unlocked the ability to craft Stempos.

### Zappy Zazzy Xombri

- **Location:** Research Lab
- **Unlocked by:** RL Quest Encourage an Ecosystem 4/4
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 25 Dust, 15 Rope, 10 Desert Stones, and 3 Fur
- **Rewards:** 1 Stempo, unlock Xombri

### Zooty Zanutaki Zings

- **Location:** Research Lab
- **Unlocked by:** RL Quest Encourage an Ecosystem 4/4
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 15 Glass Shards, 10 Nuig String, 10 Dried Pulp, and 2 Tambo Mane
- **Rewards:** 1 Stempo, unlock Zanutaki
- **Recommendations:** Welp, you're up against Dried Pulp in this, which means you'll need to have unlocked Dark Forest Outpost to complete this. And honestly it makes sense that you need something from the Dust-haunted Dark Forest to unlock this nightmare of a creature. And so far, Zanutaki are not required for any quests. And Nuig String isn't cheap, unless you've been battling a lot in Balance for other reasons. This... is not something I'd prioritize.
