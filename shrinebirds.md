# Quests - Birds

NOTE: Once you complete a quest, it's removed from these offerings. So if you have completed a quest in a prior event, it won't be available here.

### Birb's the Word

- **Unlocked by:** Wardrobe: Birds Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each:
  - Gayol
  - Noasis
  - Peq
  - Ralbone
  - Katock
- **Rewards:** 25 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** I love the pretty birds. I think they're all awesome. Basically, if you don't like this quest, it's probably a sign this isn't the Shrine Bracelet for you.

### Peppy Piñata Party

- **Unlocked by:** Wardrobe: Birds Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Katock
- **Rewards:** 50 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** Punch the piñata, 500 words at a time, and get shinies. What's not to like?

### Prime Birb Time

- **Unlocked by:** Wardrobe: Birds Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Gayol, 3 Peq, and 1 Ralbone
- **Rewards:** 25 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** The pride of defeating Ralbone should be the queen of this quest, but honestly, I think the Peq are more demanding. Still, 25 Shrine Stones is 25 Shrine Stones!
