# New Quests For 21 & 23 April

## Consider Prioritizing

###Gratitude Journal Oge-Mai Edition

- **Location:** Global
- **Unlocked by:** April 21st Event Drop
- **Type:** Streak, Forum
- **Requirements:** Attain a 44-day Streak, have 4 Forum posts
- **Rewards:** 10 Core Crystals and 44 Reactions: Gratitude
- **Recommendations:**  Anything that gets Crystals is a priority in my book - and if you participate in the Gratitude Journal Oge Mai Edition thread, you're getting a chance at a lot more (and participating in a lovely tradition). Here's the thread: https://4thewords.com/forum/thread/gratitude-journal-oge-mai-edition

###2B or Not 2B? 1/3

- **Location:** Global
- **Unlocked by:** April 23rd Two Billion Word Celebration
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Paper Wignow
- **Rewards:** 5 Festival Tokens and Wardrobe: Paper Shoes https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1690-paper-shoes-12429-31350.png
- **Recommendations:**  I recommend prioritizing this solely because the Paper Shoes are the legacy item for this event and this is a more efficient way to get those items. (The rest of the quest chain is probably worth prioritizing just because you get nice souvenirs that way.) Besides, you'll want to be able to say that you participated in the 2 Billion Words event as it happened.

## As You Please

###2B or Not 2B? 2/3

- **Location:** Global
- **Unlocked by:** 2B or Not 2B? 1/3
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Paper Wignow
- **Rewards:** 10 Festival Tokens and Wardrobe x2: Paper Shorts https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1689-paper-shorts-12427-90647.png and Paper Skirt https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1688-paper-skirt-12425-88618.png
- **Recommendations:**  I'm really not sure why you wouldn't try to finish off this quest chain. It's fun!

###2B or Not 2B? 3/3

- **Location:** Global
- **Unlocked by:** 2B or Not 2B? 2/3
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 15 Paper Wignow
- **Rewards:** 15 Festival Tokens, Wardrobe: Paper Cloak https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1691-paper-cloak-12431-34768.png and House Item: Paper Pile https://4thewords.com/public/hideouts/hideout&#95;element&#95;450&#95;18931/variant&#95;icon&#95;2202&#95;911.png 
- **Recommendations:**  So, the Paper Pile is the first prize in this chain that has multiple variants - the image I captured is the messiest paper pile, while others are tamer. Still a lot of fun, and more importantly, Paper Wignows are too fun not to complete all their quests.

# New Monsters for 23 Apr

This event is unusual in that new monsters are scarce; most of the monsters are perfectly available in the regular game. I'm going to count anything that's newly dropping Festival Tokens as "new" for these purposes, though, and if it's not EVENT EXCLUSIVE, I'll leave a note to tell you where else to look.

Whether a monster is in an event space or its regular home, it will have the same stats. **The only real difference between this and my regular Guide entries for most of these monsters is that I'm only listing event-relevant quests, and Token drops are included.**

###Paper Wignow - EVENT EXCLUSIVE

- **Location:** Global
- **Requirements:** 100 words
- **Time allowed:** 15 minutes
- **XP:** 10
- **Drops:** 1 Festival Token, 4 Coins, 0-1 Essence (usually 1)
- **Quests:** Global: 2B or Not 2B? 1/3 (5), 2B or Not 2B? 2/3 (10), 2B or Not 2B? 3/3 (15)
