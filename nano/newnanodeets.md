# New Quests For 13 April/Water Open

## Consider Prioritizing

###Gone Fishing 1/3

- **Location:** Water Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Festival Water Open
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Puna and 3 Furoxi
- **Rewards:** 15 Festival of Oge-Mai Tokens, 6 Harpoons, and Wardrobe: Ankle Fins https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1038-ankle-fins-7593-89144.png
- **Recommendations:**  This might be worth prioritizing, because those Harpoons are lovely, lovely weapons (especially if you haven't yet hit the Water Region where they become available). Don't sell any you get from this quest - you'll need them to complete this chain. (And if you're just opening Riza, it's worth noting that there's a quest there that gives a reward for just possessing enough Harpoons without making you turn them in.)

## As You Please

###Gone Fishing 2/3

- **Location:** Water Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Gone Fishing 1/3
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 8 Puna, 4 Furoxi, and 2 Patliadu

- **Recommendations:**  The next quest in the chain has more Tokens by quite a bit than all prior quests, but apart from next quest's rewards, this one is exactly that it looks like!

###Gone Fishing 3/3

- **Location:** Water Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Gone Fishing 2/3
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 12 Puna, 6 Furoxi, and 3 Patliadu
- **Rewards:** 50 Festival of Oge-Mai Tokens, Wardrobe: Head Fin https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1043-head-fin-7603-43946.png, and House Item: Fish Mobile https://4thewords.com/public/hideouts/hideout&#95;element&#95;403&#95;66815/variant&#95;icon&#95;1975&#95;126.png

###Bounty from Cule

- **Location:** Water Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Festival Water Open
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Castu
- **Rewards:** 15 Festival of Oge-Mai Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  Castu are part of quite a few quests in the Floating City of Balance, and who knows if this "no Water Mask required for battle" will last - but no need to race to Balance if you're not around yet! Take it as you please.

###Bounty from Roiva

- **Unlocked by:** Festival Water Open
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Jaihri and 4 Caricaco

- **Unlocked by:** Festival Water Open
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Tiatu

- **Recommendations:**  As I said on Bounty from Roiva, Jaihri quests are everywhere; see what you can double up on.

- **Recommendations:**  And the trio is complete!

# New Monsters for 13 Apr/Water Open

This event is unusual in that new monsters are scarce; most of the monsters are perfectly available in the regular game. I'm going to count anything that's newly dropping Festival Tokens as "new" for these purposes, though, and if it's not EVENT EXCLUSIVE, I'll leave a note to tell you where else to look.
