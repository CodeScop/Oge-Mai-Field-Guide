# New Quests For 6 April/Desert Open

## Consider Prioritizing

###Sign of the Times

- **Location:** Desert Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Festival Desert Open
- **Type:** Streak, Wordcount
- **Requirements:** Add 10 consecutive Streak days, write 10K words
- **Rewards:** 10 Festival of Oge-Mai Tokens, 100 Coins, and House Item: Lost Sign https://4thewords.com/public/hideouts/hideout&#95;element&#95;402&#95;71710/variant&#95;icon&#95;1967&#95;431.png
- **Recommendations:**  Go ahead and pick this up quickly, to make sure you have time to enjoy your tokens before the event ends. (Oh, who are we kidding, the 100 Coins is pretty sweet regardless.) Hang in there!

###Time After Time 2/3

- **Location:** Desert Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** ForMeet Quest: Time After Time 1/3
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 15 Frizi, pay 10 Coins
- **Rewards:** House Item: Amber Trapped Frizi https://4thewords.com/public/hideouts/hideout&#95;element&#95;422&#95;51999/variant&#95;icon&#95;2073&#95;148.png
- **Recommendations:**  This is part of a quest chain that started with Time After Time 1/3 in the Forest area. Since the chain seems likely to continue in the Water, maybe prioritize a bit

## As You Please

###Bare Bone Communication

- **Location:** Desert Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Festival Desert Open
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 6 Grult
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Grult Fur Vest https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1115-grult-fur-vest-8019-43140.png
- **Recommendations:**  What You See Is What You Get. It's pretty easy to decide what you want out of this one!

###Bounty from Shari of Sands

- **Location:** Desert Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Festival Desert Open
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 12 Kiru
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Tiny Kiru https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1031-kiru-granade-7563-53372.png
- **Recommendations:**  Lookit the cute tiny Kiru! Excuse me, off battling. (Note that the Bounty from Waute has some overlap here.)

###Bounty from Waute

- **Location:** Desert Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Festival Desert Open
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Kiru, 3 Frizi, and 3 Zera
- **Rewards:** 15 Festival of Oge-Mai Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  This is one of two quests for Kiru this event, and one of three for Frizi; consider looking over them for overlap. (Or don't, and end up with more Festival Tokens when you battle more monsters.)

###Bubbled Water for Bevrex

- **Location:** Desert Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Festival Desert Open
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Bevrex and 5 Kuikas
- **Rewards:** 15 Festival of Oge-Mai Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  If you really want to, you can double the Kuikas up with Watering the Desert and save yourself five. Probably not important, though.

###Frizi, Fun, and Family

- **Location:** Desert Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Festival Desert Open
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Frizi, deliver 5 Raw Fabric
- **Rewards:** 15 Festival of Oge-Mai Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  The Raw Fabric will come from the Frizi battles and to spare, so don't worry about that. Keep an eye out to pick up Bounty from Waute and Time After Time 2/3 if you want to maximize Frizi efficiency.

###Tears of the Custra

- **Location:** Desert Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Festival Desert Open
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 5 Raw Stone, 5 Raw Fabric, 1 Desert Stone, and 5 Raw Steel
- **Rewards:** 20 Festival of Oge-Mai Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  Make no mistake: these are all valuable resources (although Raw Fabric is also so widely available that it's pretty easy to accrue enough to sell off). The amount, however, is pretty darn small to pay off; check out the Resources below to figure out how to grind them just from the event! (Raw Fabric, for instance, will be generated when you take Frizi quests, Raw Stone from Grult quests...)

###Watering the Desert

- **Location:** Desert Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Festival Desert Open
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 20 Kuikas
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Kuikas Necklace https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1676-desert-beetle-necklace-12394-70370.png
- **Recommendations:**  A lovely little quest reward from a lovely little quest (yes, it's a lot of Kuikas, but they're tiny and quick to beat). No tricks here!

###Where Yasri Wander 1/2

- **Location:** Desert Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Festival Desert Open
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 2 Yasri
- **Rewards:** 15 Festival of Oge-Mai Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  Yasri are Yasri. (If you're working on Desert Main Quests during this event, you might want to peek ahead and see how well you can dovetail this with main game quests.) They can be intimidating, but they're incredibly rewarding, even apart from Festival rewards. If you can knock both of these Yasri out in one day, you'll be able to pick up the next quest and be halfway through!

###Bruja Fear Treading 2/2

- **Location:** Desert Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Where Yasri Wander 1/2
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Yasri
- **Rewards:** 10 Festival of Oge-Mai Tokens, House Item: Yasri Skull https://4thewords.com/public/hideouts/hideout&#95;element&#95;394&#95;36153/variant&#95;icon&#95;1914&#95;120.png
- **Recommendations:**  You're an old pro at Yasri by now, right? You've got this without me. 

# New Monsters for 6 Apr/Desert Open

This event is unusual in that new monsters are scarce; most of the monsters are perfectly available in the regular game. I'm going to count anything that's newly dropping Festival Tokens as "new" for these purposes, though, and if it's not EVENT EXCLUSIVE, I'll leave a note to tell you where else to look.

Whether a monster is in an event space or its regular home, it will have the same stats. **The only real difference between this and my regular Guide entries for most of these monsters is that I'm only listing event-relevant quests, and Token drops are included.**
