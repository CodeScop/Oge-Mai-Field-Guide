# New Quests As Of 31 March

## Consider Prioritizing

###Heart of Sunshine

- **Location:** Forest Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Festival Open
- **Type:** Streak, Wordcount
- **Requirements:** Add 5 consecutive days to your streak, write 5,000 words
- **Rewards:** 10 Festival of Oge-Mai Tokens and House Item: Vine Stairs https://4thewords.com/public/hideouts/hideout&#95;element&#95;417&#95;19298/variant&#95;icon&#95;2060&#95;610.png
- **Recommendations:**  Prioritize this in that it's always nice to get started on streak quests to get them out of the way; if you're not inclined to get streak quests done, this can hang in there till the very end.

###Time After Time 1/3

- **Location:** Forest Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Festival Open
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 15 Reenu, pay 10 Coins
- **Rewards:** House Item: Amber Trapped Reenu https://4thewords.com/public/hideouts/hideout&#95;element&#95;416&#95;98133/variant&#95;icon&#95;2056&#95;575.png
- **Recommendations:**  As of the opening, there's a week till the next part of this chain unlocks; you have that long to dither about it and decide how urgent it is for you!

###The Rudakai Theory 1/3

- **Location:** Forest Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Festival Open
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Wignow and 10 Kai
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Rudakai Beard https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1632-rudakai-beard-11952-12172.png
- **Recommendations:**  This quest chain involves a lot of Kai-fighting. If you've been around the Valley long, you'll know that anything battled since midnight will count toward any quests you pick up before the next midnight - so these Kai could theoretically count for up to three times their worth, if you can manage to wipe out two quests and pick up the third in one day. If that's too much for you, do the math on how you can get the most Kai overlap.

###The Rudakai Theory 2/3

- **Location:** Forest Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** The Rudakai Theory 1/3
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Rudakai and 10 Kai
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Rudakai Eyes https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1658-rudakai-eyes-12186-53655.png
- **Recommendations:**  As with the last quest in this chain, plan on Kai overlap! And enjoy the lovely Rudakai Eyes this gives you.

## As You Please

###The Rudakai Theory 3/3

- **Location:** Forest Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** The Rudakai Theory 2/3
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 20 Kai
- **Rewards:** 10 Festival of Oge-Mai Tokens and Wardrobe: Rudakai Lobule Ear https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1647-rudakai-lobule-ear-12084-68880.png
- **Recommendations:**  It really takes care of itself here, doesn't it?

###Bounty from Dalse
- **Location:** Forest Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Festival Open
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 8 Nezthai
- **Rewards:** House Item: Nezthai Table https://4thewords.com/public/hideouts/hideout&#95;element&#95;395&#95;90411/variant&#95;icon&#95;1916&#95;286.png
- **Recommendations:**  Aha! The long-requested Nezthai quest! Nezthai Claws are very valuable for fighting monsters in Tall Trees, and useless for almost everything else - just like your average Nezthai battle. But now they're a great source of Tokens (both Festival of Oge-Mai and Hunter!) and having a proper quest is the icing on the cake.

###Bounty from Marai
- **Location:** Forest Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Festival Open
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 15 Sacer
- **Rewards:** House Item: Sacer Scissors https://4thewords.com/public/hideouts/hideout&#95;element&#95;393&#95;56595/variant&#95;icon&#95;1912&#95;193.png
- **Recommendations:**  Up to you! I admit to being mildly disappointed that the lovely scissors are merely a house item, but it's a fairly easy quest.

###Thank the Trees

- **Location:** Forest Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Festival Open
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 3 Essence, 1 Spider Poison, and 5 Dust
- **Rewards:** 10 Festival of Oge-Mai Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  Simple, straightforward, and really only worth it if you weren't saving that Essence and Spider Poison for anything anyway. (Dust is usually easy to come by.)

# New Monsters as of March 31

This event is unusual in that new monsters are scarce; most of the monsters are perfectly available in the regular game. I'm going to count anything that's newly dropping Festival Tokens as "new" for these purposes, though, and if it's not EVENT EXCLUSIVE, I'll leave a note to tell you where else to look.

Whether a monster is in an event space or its regular home, it will have the same stats. **The only real difference between this and my regular Guide entries for most of these monsters is that I'm only listing event-relevant quests.**
