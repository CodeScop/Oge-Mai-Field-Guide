# New Quests For 17 April

## Consider Prioritizing

None of these is more urgent to pick up than any other, in my opinion.

## As You Please

###Gusts of Air

- **Location:** Forest Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** April 17th Event Drop
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 15 Buhini
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Winter Buhini Scarf https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1578-winter-buhini-scarf-11178-69152.png
- **Recommendations:**  This is quite a lovely scarf and, now that the Buhini Flute saves you from needing to pay for each Buhini battle, it's a lot more fun to play with those little owlets. It is a one-variant reward, though, so be aware.

###Rea & Pira's Challenge 1/2

- **Location:** Water Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** April 17th Event Drop
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Majal and 4 Paol
- **Rewards:** 20 Festival of Oge-Mai Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  No particular advice here! The news has already spoiled the culmination of this chain, namely: getting the Water Wrist Guards, and it's up to you to decide how much that's worth to you!

###Rea & Pira's Challenge 2/2

- **Location:** Water Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Rea & Pira's Challenge 1/2
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 2 Majal and 6 Paol
- **Rewards:** 20 Festival of Oge-Mai Tokens and Wardrobe: Water Wrist Guards, which have 3 variants:
  - right wrist only: https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1679-water-wrist-guards-12402-80632.png
  - left wrist only: https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1679-water-wrist-guards-12401-61190.png
  - both wrists: https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1679-water-wrist-guards-12406-44324.png
- **Recommendations:**  You know the drill. You got this.

# New Monsters for 17 Apr

This event is unusual in that new monsters are scarce; most of the monsters are perfectly available in the regular game. I'm going to count anything that's newly dropping Festival Tokens as "new" for these purposes, though, and if it's not EVENT EXCLUSIVE, I'll leave a note to tell you where else to look.

Whether a monster is in an event space or its regular home, it will have the same stats. **The only real difference between this and my regular Guide entries for most of these monsters is that I'm only listing event-relevant quests, and Token drops are included.**
