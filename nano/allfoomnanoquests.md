##All Quests: Forest Region Meeting Ground

###Bad Luck Ridan?

- **Location:** Forest Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** April 3rd Event Drop
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Ridan and 10 Ardia
- **Rewards:** 10 Festival of Oge-Mai Tokens and Wardrobe: Ridan Mouth with three variant colors for the mouth glow:
  - Ardia gold:  https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1674-mini-guardian-mouth-12382-10749.png
  - Ardis purple: https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1674-mini-guardian-mouth-12385-99512.png
  - Ardii blue: https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1674-mini-guardian-mouth-12387-25493.png
- **Recommendations:**  This is a bit of a bind if you're early in the game, since Ardia have left the event areas and they're pretty deep in the Forest Expedition, but on the other hand Ridan is new and there's no telling where/whether they'll turn up later. Still, no harm in picking it up, and the wardrobe is reliably there regardless. **Remember that the Tokens will be worthless after the event;** if you want to make good use of them, unlock Forward Base and fight the Ardia before the event ends. (See the Travel Directions section of the Guide to find out how to find Forward Base in the Forest Expedition.)

###Bounty from Dalse

- **Location:** Forest Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Festival Open
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 8 Nezthai
- **Rewards:** House Item: Nezthai Table https://4thewords.com/public/hideouts/hideout&#95;element&#95;395&#95;90411/variant&#95;icon&#95;1916&#95;286.png
- **Recommendations:**  Aha! The long-requested Nezthai quest! Nezthai Claws are very valuable for fighting monsters in Tall Trees, and useless for almost everything else - just like your average Nezthai battle. But now they're a great source of Tokens (both Festival of Oge-Mai and Hunter!) and having a proper quest is the icing on the cake.

###Bounty from Marai

- **Location:** Forest Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Festival Open
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 15 Sacer
- **Rewards:** House Item: Sacer Scissors https://4thewords.com/public/hideouts/hideout&#95;element&#95;393&#95;56595/variant&#95;icon&#95;1912&#95;193.png
- **Recommendations:**  Up to you! I admit to being mildly disappointed that the lovely scissors are merely a house item, but it's a fairly easy quest.

###Gusts of Air

- **Location:** Forest Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** April 17th Event Drop
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 15 Buhini
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Winter Buhini Scarf https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1578-winter-buhini-scarf-11178-69152.png
- **Recommendations:**  This is quite a lovely scarf and, now that the Buhini Flute saves you from needing to pay for each Buhini battle, it's a lot more fun to play with those little owlets. It is a one-variant reward, though, so be aware.

###Heart of Sunshine

- **Location:** Forest Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Festival Open
- **Type:** Streak, Wordcount
- **Requirements:** Add 5 consecutive days to your streak, write 5,000 words
- **Rewards:** 10 Festival of Oge-Mai Tokens and House Item: Vine Stairs https://4thewords.com/public/hideouts/hideout&#95;element&#95;417&#95;19298/variant&#95;icon&#95;2060&#95;610.png
- **Recommendations:**  Prioritize this in that it's always nice to get started on streak quests to get them out of the way; if you're not inclined to get streak quests done, this can hang in there till the very end.

###A Little Luciola Luck 1/2

- **Location:** Forest Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** April 2nd Event Drop
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Irsea
- **Rewards:** 10 Festival of Oge-Mai Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  A nice little quest, probably doable in a day; make sure you turn it in promptly and pick up the next one to count your battles twice! 

###A Little Luciola Luck 2/2

- **Location:** Forest Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** A Little Luciola Luck 1/2
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Irsea
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Irsea Antenna, with two variants: 
  - burning: https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1673-worm-antenna-12374-78848.png
  - plain: https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1673-worm-antenna-12377-44600.png
- **Recommendations:**  Pretty self-explanatory!

###The Rudakai Theory 1/3

- **Location:** Forest Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Festival Open
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Wignow and 10 Kai
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Rudakai Beard 
  - short: https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1632-rudakai-beard-11952-12172.png
  - braided: https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1632-rudakai-beard-11955-85845.png
- **Recommendations:**  This quest chain involves a lot of Kai-fighting. If you've been around the Valley long, you'll know that anything battled since midnight will count toward any quests you pick up before the next midnight - so these Kai could theoretically count for up to three times their worth, if you can manage to wipe out two quests and pick up the third in one day. If that's too much for you, do the math on how you can get the most Kai overlap.

###The Rudakai Theory 2/3

- **Location:** Forest Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** The Rudakai Theory 1/3
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Rudakai and 10 Kai
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Rudakai Eyes (four variants):
  - Dust Rudakai: https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1658-rudakai-eyes-12186-53655.png
  - Desert Rudakai: https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#951658-rudakai-eyes-12187-63248.png
  - Water Rudakai: https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#951658-rudakai-eyes-12189-96013.png
  - Rudakai: https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#951658-rudakai-eyes-12191-60947.png
- **Recommendations:**  As with the last quest in this chain, plan on Kai overlap! And enjoy the lovely Rudakai Eyes this gives you.

###The Rudakai Theory 3/3

- **Location:** Forest Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** The Rudakai Theory 2/3
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 20 Kai
- **Rewards:** 10 Festival of Oge-Mai Tokens and Wardrobe: Rudakai Lobule Ear https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1647-rudakai-lobule-ear-12084-68880.png (available to match each skin tone)
- **Recommendations:**  It really takes care of itself here, doesn't it?

###Shades of Gold

- **Unlocked by:** April 3rd Event Drop
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Ridan and 5 Irsea
- **Rewards:** 10 Festival of Oge-Mai Tokens and Wardrobe: Irsea Eyes, with three variants:
  - open: https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1672-worm-eyes-12372-66986.png 
  - closed: https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1672-worm-eyes-12380-60439.png
  - cracked open: https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1672-worm-eyes-12381-12679.png
- **Recommendations:**  Self-explanatory! No tricks or trades. :) 

###Time After Time 1/3

- **Location:** Forest Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Festival Open
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 15 Reenu, pay 10 Coins
- **Rewards:** House Item: Amber Trapped Reenu https://4thewords.com/public/hideouts/hideout&#95;element&#95;416&#95;98133/variant&#95;icon&#95;2056&#95;575.png
- **Recommendations:**  As of the opening, there's a week till the next part of this chain unlocks; you have that long to dither about it and decide how urgent it is for you!

###Thank the Trees

- **Location:** Forest Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Festival Open
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 3 Essence, 1 Spider Poison, and 5 Dust
- **Rewards:** 10 Festival of Oge-Mai Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  Simple, straightforward, and really only worth it if you weren't saving that Essence and Spider Poison for anything anyway. (Dust is usually easy to come by.)

## All Quests: Desert Region Meeting Ground

###Bare Bone Communication

- **Location:** Desert Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Festival Desert Open
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 6 Grult
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Grult Fur Vest https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1115-grult-fur-vest-8019-43140.png
- **Recommendations:**  What You See Is What You Get. It's pretty easy to decide what you want out of this one!

###Bounty from Shari of Sands

- **Location:** Desert Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Festival Desert Open
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 12 Kiru
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Tiny Kiru https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1031-kiru-granade-7563-53372.png
- **Recommendations:**  Lookit the cute tiny Kiru! Excuse me, off battling. (Note that the Bounty from Waute has some overlap here.)

###Bounty from Waute

- **Location:** Desert Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Festival Desert Open
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Kiru, 3 Frizi, and 3 Zera
- **Rewards:** 15 Festival of Oge-Mai Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  This is one of two quests for Kiru this event, and one of three for Frizi; consider looking over them for overlap. (Or don't, and end up with more Festival Tokens when you battle more monsters.)

###Bubbled Water for Bevrex

- **Location:** Desert Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Festival Desert Open
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Bevrex and 5 Kuikas
- **Rewards:** 15 Festival of Oge-Mai Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  If you really want to, you can double the Kuikas up with Watering the Desert and save yourself five. Probably not important, though.

###Frizi, Fun, and Family

- **Location:** Desert Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Festival Desert Open
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Frizi, deliver 5 Raw Fabric
- **Rewards:** 15 Festival of Oge-Mai Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  The Raw Fabric will come from the Frizi battles and to spare, so don't worry about that. Keep an eye out to pick up Bounty from Waute and Time After Time 2/3 if you want to maximize Frizi efficiency.

###Sign of the Times

- **Location:** Desert Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Festival Desert Open
- **Type:** Streak, Wordcount
- **Requirements:** Add 10 consecutive Streak days, write 10K words
- **Rewards:** 10 Festival of Oge-Mai Tokens, 100 Coins, and House Item: Lost Sign https://4thewords.com/public/hideouts/hideout&#95;element&#95;402&#95;71710/variant&#95;icon&#95;1967&#95;431.png
- **Recommendations:**  Go ahead and pick this up quickly, to make sure you have time to enjoy your tokens before the event ends. (Oh, who are we kidding, the 100 Coins is pretty sweet regardless.) Hang in there!

###Tears of the Custra

- **Location:** Desert Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Festival Desert Open
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 5 Raw Stone, 5 Raw Fabric, 1 Desert Stone, and 5 Raw Steel
- **Rewards:** 20 Festival of Oge-Mai Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  Make no mistake: these are all valuable resources (although Raw Fabric is also so widely available that it's pretty easy to accrue enough to sell off). The amount, however, is pretty darn small to pay off; check out the Resources below to figure out how to grind them just from the event! (Raw Fabric, for instance, will be generated when you take Frizi quests, Raw Stone from Grult quests...)

###Time After Time 2/3

- **Location:** Desert Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** ForMeet Quest: Time After Time 1/3
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 15 Frizi, pay 10 Coins
- **Rewards:** House Item: Amber Trapped Frizi https://4thewords.com/public/hideouts/hideout&#95;element&#95;422&#95;51999/variant&#95;icon&#95;2073&#95;148.png
- **Recommendations:**  This is part of a quest chain that started with Time After Time 1/3 in the Forest area. Since the chain seems likely to continue in the Water, maybe prioritize a bit

###Troubles With Torkan 1/2

- **Location:** Desert Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** April 10th Event Drop
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Torkan
- **Rewards:** 15 Festival of Oge-Mai Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  Try and do as much of this as possible on the last day you're doing it - it'll allow for the most overlap with the next quest in the series.

###Troubles With Torkan 2/2

- **Location:** Desert Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Troubles With Torkan 1/2
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Torkan and 8 Kuikas
- **Rewards:** 15 Festival of Oge-Mai Tokens and Wardrobe: Torkan Head https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1677-volcano-head-12397-95319.png (one variant only)
- **Recommendations:**  Just when you thought you were done with Kuikas! These birdies are everywhere, apparently providing useful fertilizer. At least this is it for this quest chain!

###Watering the Desert

- **Location:** Desert Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Festival Desert Open
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 20 Kuikas
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Kuikas Necklace https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1676-desert-beetle-necklace-12394-70370.png
- **Recommendations:**  A lovely little quest reward from a lovely little quest (yes, it's a lot of Kuikas, but they're tiny and quick to beat). No tricks here! Apart from "dovetail with as many Kuikas quests as possible"; there's three overall.

###Where Yasri Wander 1/2

- **Location:** Desert Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Festival Desert Open
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 2 Yasri
- **Rewards:** 15 Festival of Oge-Mai Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  Yasri are Yasri. (If you're working on Desert Main Quests during this event, you might want to peek ahead and see how well you can dovetail this with main game quests.) They can be intimidating, but they're incredibly rewarding, even apart from Festival rewards. If you can knock both of these Yasri out in one day, you'll be able to pick up the next quest and be halfway through!

###Bruja Fear Treading 2/2

- **Location:** Desert Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Where Yasri Wander 1/2
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Yasri
- **Rewards:** 10 Festival of Oge-Mai Tokens, House Item: Yasri Skull https://4thewords.com/public/hideouts/hideout&#95;element&#95;394&#95;36153/variant&#95;icon&#95;1914&#95;120.png
- **Recommendations:**  You're an old pro at Yasri by now, right? You've got this without me. 

## All Quests: Water Region Meeting Ground

###Bounty from Cule

- **Location:** Water Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Festival Water Open
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Castu
- **Rewards:** 15 Festival of Oge-Mai Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  Castu are part of quite a few quests in the Floating City of Balance, and who knows if this "no Water Mask required for battle" will last - but no need to race to Balance if you're not around yet! Take it as you please.

###Bounty from Roiva

- **Location:** Water Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Festival Water Open
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Jaihri and 4 Caricaco
- **Rewards:** 15 Festival of Oge-Mai Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  Self-explanatory. Jaihri are popular opponents in Riza and early Raina, so check if there's anything you want to double up on.

###Fortune Hunting in Balance (1/2)

- **Location:** Water Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Festival Water Open
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Tiatu
- **Rewards:** 15 Festival of Oge-Mai Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Our event monster of the region! Bet you can guess the rough outline of Part 2. (Hint: you'd do well to complete this on one day and pick up the next immediately.)

###Fortune Hunting in Balance (2/2)

- **Location:** Water Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Fortune Hunting in Balance (1/2)
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 12 Tiatu
- **Rewards:** 10 Festival of Oge-Mai Tokens and Wardrobe: Reinforced Rope Scarf https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1678-reinforced-rope-scarf-12399-44571.png
- **Recommendations:**  Hey look, you guessed! Personally, I'm pleased that Tiatu are so simple to battle.

###Gnaw, Nibble, Nom

- **Location:** Water Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Festival Water Open
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 6 Jaihri
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Chewed Log Crown https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1039-chewed-log-crown-7595-30268.png
- **Recommendations:**  As I said on Bounty from Roiva, Jaihri quests are everywhere; see what you can double up on.

###Gone Fishing 1/3

- **Location:** Water Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Festival Water Open
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Puna and 3 Furoxi
- **Rewards:** 15 Festival of Oge-Mai Tokens, 6 Harpoons, and Wardrobe: Ankle Fins https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1038-ankle-fins-7593-89144.png
- **Recommendations:**  This might be worth prioritizing, because those Harpoons are lovely, lovely weapons (especially if you haven't yet hit the Water Region where they become available). Don't sell any you get from this quest - you'll need them to complete this chain. (And if you're just opening Riza, it's worth noting that there's a quest there that gives a reward for just possessing enough Harpoons without making you turn them in.)

###Gone Fishing 2/3

- **Location:** Water Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Gone Fishing 1/3
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 8 Puna, 4 Furoxi, and 2 Patliadu
- **Rewards:** 15 Festival of Oge-Mai Tokens and Wardrobe: Forearm Fins https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1042-forearm-fins-7601-65231.png
- **Recommendations:**  The next quest in the chain has more Tokens by quite a bit than all prior quests, but apart from next quest's rewards, this one is exactly that it looks like!

###Gone Fishing 3/3

- **Location:** Water Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Gone Fishing 2/3
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 12 Puna, 6 Furoxi, and 3 Patliadu
- **Rewards:** 50 Festival of Oge-Mai Tokens, Wardrobe: Head Fin https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1043-head-fin-7603-43946.png, and House Item: Fish Mobile https://4thewords.com/public/hideouts/hideout&#95;element&#95;403&#95;66815/variant&#95;icon&#95;1975&#95;126.png
- **Recommendations:**  You can totally tell what's good here. :)

###Rea & Pira's Challenge 1/2

- **Location:** Water Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** April 17th Event Drop
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Majal and 4 Paol
- **Rewards:** 20 Festival of Oge-Mai Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  No particular advice here! The news has already spoiled the culmination of this chain, namely: getting the Water Wrist Guards, and it's up to you to decide how much that's worth to you!

###Rea & Pira's Challenge 2/2

- **Location:** Water Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** Rea & Pira's Challenge 1/2
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 2 Majal and 6 Paol
- **Rewards:** 20 Festival of Oge-Mai Tokens and Wardrobe: Water Wrist Guards, which have 3 variants:
  - right wrist only: https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1679-water-wrist-guards-12402-80632.png
  - left wrist only: https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1679-water-wrist-guards-12401-61190.png
  - both wrists: https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1679-water-wrist-guards-12406-44324.png
- **Recommendations:**  You know the drill. You got this.

###Time After Time 3/3

- **Location:** Water Region Meeting Ground
- **Unlocked by:** DesMeet Quest: Time After Time 2/3
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 15 Caricaco and deliver 10 Coins
- **Rewards:** House Item: Amber Trapped Caricaco https://4thewords.com/public/hideouts/hideout&#95;element&#95;428&#95;62161/variant&#95;icon&#95;2099&#95;928.png
- **Recommendations:**  And the trio is complete!
