LAST UPDATED 10 APR 2021

So, when I say "outside game", I mean "this is info that's in the regular Guide and I'm not going to copy it here, because I have no idea where you are in the game and what will constitute spoilers." Also note that **Vi, Viyu, Viyusa, Xin, and Awa are global monsters available everywhere, and I am not including their info here**. Because this is Event Info Only. Not that anyone's likely to need any info apart from the Tokens, seeing how few collection-oriented quests we have and how familiar the monsters are, but I'm upholding tradition here!
