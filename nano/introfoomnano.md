(Yes, my timestamp is that detailed, because I'm going to be updating later today if all goes well.)

So I usually try to keep a lot of detail for events, and I intend to do the same here! But I had some pressing questions to research before I got into anything methodical, and I'm presenting the results here in case anyone else has the same questions:

1) **No, it doesn't matter where you pick up or fight the monsters.** Whether it's in the Forest Region Meeting Ground or its native area, the monsters will have the same drops and count the same for the same quests. It looks like the drops outside the Festival haven't updated their icons as of this writing - Sacer, for instance, in Base Camp looks like they're dropping Hunter Tokens, which they're not since the festival dropped, and none of the monsters LOOK like they're dropping Festival of Oge-Mai Tokens, but these appearances are deceiving: all are dropping what they're dropping in the Meeting Ground.

2) **No, there are no battle items as of yet.** NaNo events often have really sweet items as a reward, but it's unsurprising that this Camp NaNo has no weapons this early, especially since many Camp events have no battle items at all. Anything that's not shown on an avatar is a House Item, and so far, I've found no uses for the House Items. (... from the description of at least one, I am suddenly wildly hopeful yet not remotely optimistic that that's going to change.)

(And the third no longer applies - yes, travel is free to and from the event area!)
