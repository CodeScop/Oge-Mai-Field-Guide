LAST UPDATED 7 APR 2021

Welcome to the Festival of Oge-Mai! Or as I'm calling it in my notes, FoOM. As in, FOOM! We're off!

This event is a new direction in that most of the monsters are regular Oge-Mai denizens, conscripted for festival purposes. As I'll probably repeat ad nauseam, there is no difference between the monsters in the event space (so far) and the monsters in their natural habitat; this should give you a chance to catch up on overlapping quests from the rest of the game.

As in the regular Guide, I'll be giving you updates on the Quests, Monsters, and Resources relevant to the game. I'll also try to grab images of wardrobe variants for quest rewards, so you can better make an informed decision about wandering down quest chains.

Event Milestones:

- Wed 31 March: Event opens, with Forest Region Meeting Ground becoming available with Kai (new arrival!), Nezthai, Reenu, Rudakai, Sacer, and Wignow, along with 8 quests involving no other monsters.
- Fri 2 Apr: Irsea arrives, along with the Little Luciola Luck pair of quests.
- Sat 3 Apr: Ridan arrives, along with the quests Bad Luck Ridan? and Shades of Gold. Ardia briefly join the Festival, appearing in the FRMG and dropping Festival Tokens and Reactions everywhere they appear.
- Tues 6 Apr: Ardia leave the Festival and go back to normal. Desert Region Meeting Ground becomes available, with Bevrex, Frizi, Grult, Kiru, Kuikas (new for the event!), Yasri, and Zera, along with 11 quests.

And now! What's new!
