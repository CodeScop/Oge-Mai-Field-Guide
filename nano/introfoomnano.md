LAST UPDATED 31 MAR 2021

Welcome to the Festival of Oge-Mai! Or as I'm calling it in my notes, FoOM. As in, FOOM! We're off!

This event is a new direction in that most of the monsters are regular Oge-Mai denizens, conscripted for festival purposes. As I'll probably repeat ad nauseam, there is no difference between the monsters in the event space (so far) and the monsters in their natural habitat; this should give you a chance to catch up on overlapping quests from the rest of the game.

As in the regular Guide, I'll be giving you updates on the Quests, Monsters, and Resources relevant to the game (although resources will be a low priority for me to track, as all non-Festival Token resources are already listed in my regular Guide, and the Festival Tokens are very consistent at dropping roughly 1 per 100 words). I'll also try to grab images of wardrobe variants for quest rewards, so you can better make an informed decision about wandering down quest chains.

But first! What's new! (i.e. everything)
