LAST UPDATED 5 MAR 2021

Okay! So, I'm going to try to consolidate ALL THE QUESTS in the game. Everything that isn't a Main Quest will be listed in alphabetical order after the Main Quests. The Main Quests will be in order, since it's a clearly defined road; and that "road" metaphor will extend in multiple directions. Hence, the new "Route" line of info to tell you how to find it/where you picked it up.

**The Main Quest Highway** is the main questline of the game, the backbone which unlocks everything else. This line, and only this line, will be defined solely by where it is in the sequence; the Route will tell you where it is in that sequence (LF MQ 3 for the third Main Quest in the Luciola Forest sequence, etc)

**The Expedition Trails** branch off of this Main Quest Highway (so does the **Hunt Trail**) at defined locations. The Route will tell you where it branches off the Main Quest Highway (i.e. which Main Quest unlocks the sidequest that unlocks the Expedition/Hunt) and list out all quests on that Trail. So the quest Joining the Hunt, located in Luciola Forest on the Hunt Trail would read "Hunt Trail Route: (available from game open) • **HuntS1 Joining the Hunt** • HuntS1 The Hunt Begins" etc.

**Quest Paths** are basically a questline off to the side, which don't lead anywhere in particular. To save myself space, they'll be allowed to jump off of Expedition Trails as well as Main Quests. So the quest Battle of Merit, which is unlocked by a quest which is unlocked by The Hunt Begins, would look thus: "Quest Path Route: (open via Hunt Trail HuntS1 The Hunt Begins) • HuntS1 A Battle of Wills • **Battle of Merit** • HuntS1 Battle of Constitution • HuntS1 A Battle of Evolution"

**Lone Quests** are quests which are unlocked by something on the Main Quest Highway or a Trail; instead of a Route, these will simply have an "Unlocked by" field.

And to help keep all these straight... well, there's three options. You can check out the Questline listing and nesting quests for the whole game, or you can see the Travel Directions section for the Highway and Trails in more detail than you may want, or you can see the helpful quick list down at the very bottom of the page.

Here goes nothing!

# Main Quests, in Order of Unlocking

### LF Main Quest 1: Luciola Forest Caretaker

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Main Quest Highway:** LF MQ1
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Fight 4 Wignows (total: 1000 battle words)
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendation:** Go ahead and polish this off, then go play around! There's a lot of fun exploring to do. Monsters, sidequests... Don't forget to return to your Questbook (or the Current tab in your Lore book) to deliver the quest when you're done!

### LF Main Quest 2: Building, Not Burning

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Main Quest Highway:** LF MQ2
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect materials for Kyiat's Bridge - 2 Rope, 2 Spider Legs, 6 Wood
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendation:** This one can be a little tricky, because it's not enough to collect the materials (Rope is easiest to find with Awa, Spider Legs with Aracni, and Wood with Xin, by the way). After collecting the materials, you have to go to the Item Shop (Alex's Shop) to craft Kyiat's Bridge before you can deliver it.

### LF Main Quest 3: The Nitana 

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Main Quest Highway:** LF MQ3
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Battle a Nitana
- **Rewards:** Tesven's Amulet, 25 Coins
- **Recommendation:** You've got this! This quest used to be The Rudakai. Imagine battling twice as many words and needing several other resources to get started! But this is very doable.

### LF Main Quest 4: Don't Regift Curses 

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Main Quest Highway:** LF MQ4
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect Tesven's Amulet, 4 Essence, 8 Dust, and 4 Leaves
- **Rewards:** Mama Tree unlocks
- **Recommendation:** Hopefully you have Tesven's Amulet from the previous quest You may well have everything you need already at this point. Essence is the trickiest bit here; at low Luck, your best bet is probably battling Grey's Mawt, which drops at least one Essence and often two; if you're feeling up to a 25-minute sprint, Viyusa just might drop all you need at one go. As your Luck increases, Wignow become more reliable Essence providers and cost fewer words. And if you're trying to remember what Luck is and how it works, double-check the FAQ back at the beginning of the Guide. :)

### MT Main Quest 1: To Great Heights

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Main Quest Highway:** MT MQ1 (after Luciola Forest)
- **Type:** Battle & Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Lorsa and craft 1 Lorsa Nest
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendations:** Lorsa are nice and straightforward. The Lorsa Nest probably won't take long to scrounge for: you'll need 6 Leaves, 2 Claws, 10 Wood, and 5 Rope, which you can get from fighting a Tylu (2-3 Claws and 1 Leaf), 3 Awas (6 Rope and around 5 Leaves and 4 Wood), and 4 Xin (around 7 Wood, plus extra Leaves), which is about 1600 words. Lorsa are also a nice source of Feathers if you want to go back to the LF Safety Hats quest.

### MT Main Quest 2: A Secret Message

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Main Quest Highway:** MT MQ2
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 3 Essence, 5 Feathers, and 8 Dust
- **Rewards:** 1 Steel Dagger
- **Recommendations:** Between Lorsa and Wignow, you should be able to cover this easily even if your previous supplies aren't up to scratch. Remember that Wignow will help with the Watering Hole sidequest, too, if you picked that up. This conflicts with the Shaman's Hideout sidequest in that they have a lot of requirements in common, but still nice to do both.

### MT Main Quest 3: Elder Library

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Main Quest Highway:** MT MQ3
- **Type:** Battle 
- **Requirements:** Defeat the Search Party
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendations:** Search Party appears as a monster in the Wilderness during the span of this quest, and only during the span of this quest. And no, it doesn't drop anything. Just go ahead and power through when you feel up to it.

### MT Main Quest 4: Aid to an Elder

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Main Quest Highway:** MT MQ4
- **Type:** Battle 
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Assassins
- **Rewards:** Suwö as Companion, Three Points Crossing unlocks, Stone of the Forest
- **Recommendations:** Up your Luck before fighting Assassins, and they're more likely to give you Wooden Keys and Steel Daggers. Also, stick around and work on some sidequests after this, because Three Points Crossing can be demanding and it's nice to be stocked up first.

### 3PC Main Quest 1: Earthquakes

- **Location:** Three Points Crossing
- **Main Quest Highway:** 3PC MQ1
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Yasri, 3 Kiru, 1 Lombri, and 1 Bruja
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest
- **Recommendations:** You'll need a Wood Spear to spend on the Lombri battle; they come relatively cheap if you head back to Mama Tree and open a Wooden Chest. (And it's never too early to start collecting Vine Nets from those chests if you want to complete all sidequests in the game.) Take your time with these, explore, and consider which sidequests you value. 3PC is much more intense, generally, than prior regions. Also, most of the quests are collection-oriented. It never hurts to stock up on textiles, Xin/Awa drops, and steel. ALSO: Do NOT use or sell any Raw Fabric, Fine Fabric, or Red Dye received in drops during this quest until you finish Main Quest 3.

### 3PC Main Quest 2: Just Another Brick

- **Location:** Three Points Crossing
- **Main Quest Highway:** 3PC MQ2
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 8 Stone, 30 Wood, 4 Steel, and 10 Rope
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest
- **Recommendations:** Shouldn't take too long, especially if you notice that Rulo drop full-fledged Stone Blocks without you needing to craft them. If, like me, you tend to run low on Wood, remember that it's always better to grind Xin or head to the Forest before you seek other options. 

### 3PC Main Quest 3: Camouflage

- **Location:** Three Points Crossing
- **Main Quest Highway:** 3PC MQ3
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Get 6 Fine Fabric, 10 Raw Fabric, and 4 Red Dye
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Desert Facemask
- **Recommendations:** I hope you saved your drops from the first quest, because if you did, you probably have at least most of what you need already. Otherwise, I recommend fighting Yasri; they're a source of all the materials you need, and 6 Yasri battles should cover all your bases. You could also fight Bruja for Red Dye, Frizi for Raw Fabric, and Desert Wignow for Essence to get all you need to craft Fine Fabric instead, but that's far more time-consuming; I'd only do that if 900-word Bruja are THAT MUCH more appealing than 1250-word Yasri.

### 3PC Main Quest 4: A Desert Army

- **Location:** Three Points Crossing
- **Main Quest Highway:** 3PC MQ4
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Fight 5 Assassins
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest
- **Recommendations:** They're Assassins. Exactly the same as Mama Tree. (In fact, if you went back to Mama Tree and fought Assassins there, it would count the same.) Assassins will disappear from Three Points Crossing once you deliver this quest, so if (like me) you like milking Assassins for Wooden Keys, it might be worth fighting a few extra while they're around before delivering the quest. (Also, the Steel Daggers they drop will be useful in the next region; you'll probably want at least a dozen.)

### 3PC Main Quest 5: A Way South

- **Location:** Three Points Crossing
- **Main Quest Highway:** 3PC MQ5
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Get 20 Wood, 10 Rope, 20 Leaves, 5 Raw Fabric, 1000 Coins, Min Level 10
- **Rewards:** Gansu Watering Hole & Azadi as Companion
- **Recommendations:** Most of these materials are simple: "fight Xin and Awa". And while you're fighting Xin, sell River Grass like there's no tomorrow. (We're approaching the time when you'll need River Grass, same as you've discovered uses for Raw Fabric, but it's still pretty safe to sell down to zero.) This is a good time to skim through the various sidequests and figure out what else you might want to collect at the same time. 

### Gansu Main Quest 1: Circle of Protection

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Main Quest Highway:** Gansu MQ1
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Wetu and 2 Rulo, and collect 15 Desert Stones
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest
- **Recommendations:** It won't hurt to collect a whole lot more Desert Stones than that. Desert Wignow will be your best source if you don't already have enough on hand.

### Gansu Main Quest 2: Lorsa Nest Network

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Main Quest Highway:** Gansu MQ2
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect/Craft 1 Lorsa Nest
- **Rewards:** 100 Coins
- **Recommendations:** Good news! This is the last time you'll be required to build a Lorsa Nest in the game (though there are some sidequests that require it). Bad news: if you don't already have enough Claws to build this, you'll have to head back to the Forest to get them. Make sure you're stocked up on Reenu Wings while you're there; you'll be needing half a dozen later.

### Gansu Main Quest 3: Sacred Shrine

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Main Quest Highway:** Gansu MQ3
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Get 10 Stone Blocks, 5 Sandstone Blocks, 5 Desert Stone, 1 White Fur, and 1 Sacred Feather
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest
- **Recommendations:** Now we're cooking! Suulan and Arenica are now available to fight. If you're low on Steel Daggers to fight them, consider going back to the Forest and fighting Assassins for them, though they're always available in the 3PC Item Bazaar also. You'll probably be spending some time there crafting Sandstone Blocks, too. This is a good time to get a lot of side quests done and dally a bit.

### Gansu Main Quest 4: The Welcoming Committee

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Main Quest Highway:** Gansu MQ4
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Lombri, 2 Yasri, 2 Kiru, and 2 Bruja
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest
- **Recommendations:** With all these Stone Chests, I hope you've been doing the Weekly Global Quests for Stone Keys! You know the routine by now.

### Gansu Main Quest 5: White Stars' Light

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Main Quest Highway:** Gansu MQ5
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 3 White Fur
- **Rewards:** 100 Coins
- **Recommendations:** Obviously this will be Suulan battles, probably two of them. Do as you will.

### Gansu Main Quest 6: Waters of History

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Main Quest Highway:** Gansu MQ6
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Kiru and 3 Bruja
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest
- **Recommendations:** This is the last quest before the two-part finale (wow, who knew there could be so many Main Quests, right?) Good time to take stock and consider how many sidequests you'd like to cross off now.

### Gansu Main Quest 7: Red Witch of the Southern Coven

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Main Quest Highway:** Gansu MQ7
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat the Red Witch (4000 words in 1000 minutes)
- **Rewards:** 1 Stempo
- **Recommendations:** You'll need a Stempo for the next quest, so don't lose or sell this one if it's your only one. Also: when you get to the next quest, READ MY RECOMMENDATION BEFORE COMPLETING.

### Gansu Main Quest 8: Dust to Dust

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Main Quest Highway:** Gansu MQ8
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat the Dust Witch (1 Stempo and 1200 words in 400 minutes)
- **Rewards:** Open Riza Rivertown, Stone of Air
- **Recommendations:** DO NOT DELIVER THIS QUEST… until you've fought the Dust Witch as many times as you can.
  Because the Dust Witch will only stick around as long as this quest is in play. And 1200 words in 400 minutes (three words per minute! c'mon!) will give you *three* Stempos in return for the one you paid, on top of a Golden Chest AND a Stone Chest. (Stone Chests get incredibly rare incredibly soon. Don't waste the opportunity.) Sure, you won't be able to open them until you get the Stone Keys one slow week at a time (although there are more Stone Key quests ahead), but it's worth the investment. Plus, those Protective Mantles you can sell for cash at the time being.

### Riza Main Quest 1: Jaihri Dam

- **Location:** Riza Rivertown
- **Main Quest Highway:** Riza MQ1
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 6 Jaihri
- **Rewards:** 100 Coins
- **Recommendations:** Make sure to pick up the River Dams sidequest at the same time to double up the Jaihri quest credit.

### Riza Main Quest 2: Attack of Opportunity

- **Location:** Riza Rivertown
- **Main Quest Highway:** Riza MQ2
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 2 Yasri, 1 Bruja, and 2 Kiru
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest
- **Recommendations:** I honestly might go back to 3PC to fight these guys and stock up on the Quest 3 materials while at it. You'll need at least 10 Steel later, at least 3 Leaf Boots, a bunch of Rope, and weird things like Reenu Wings and Spider Poison. But by now, you've fought enough of these guys to know whether you want to stick around and how you want to approach them.

### Riza Main Quest 3: Remedy for a Friend

- **Location:** Riza Rivertown
- **Main Quest Highway:** Riza MQ3
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 6 Spider Poison, 6 Reenu Wings, 3 Desert Stone, 3 Glass Shards, 3 River Stones, 5 River Grass
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest
- **Recommendations:** It is what it is. The good news: this is the last Main Quest for a while that has requirements that might send you back to other regions.

### Riza Main Quest 4: Mucky, Murky, Muddy

- **Location:** Riza Rivertown
- **Main Quest Highway:** Riza MQ4
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 2 Jaihri, 4 Vota, 6 Yala, and 3 Knusha
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Key
- **Recommendations:** Mix and match as you see fit. This is straightforward.

### Riza Main Quest 5: This Might Sting

- **Location:** Riza Rivertown
- **Main Quest Highway:** Riza MQ5
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat Wyvern
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest
- **Recommendations:** I <3 the Wyvern. 24 hours to get 1300 words? And the drops? A lot simpler than the last one, and a welcome break before the next one.

### Riza Main Quest 6: Journey Upriver

- **Location:** Riza Rivertown
- **Main Quest Highway:** Riza MQ6
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Gather 25 Hardwood, 10 Steel, and 5 Dí Bags
- **Rewards:** Floating City of Balance
- **Recommendations:** Dí Bags are usually easier to buy outright than to collect enough River Water to make. (And you'll be doing at least 3 more soon.) But if you want to do it the less-coin-intensive way, Yala are probably your best River Water source. (Osaril may be slightly more productive, but Vine Nets are harder to farm to get them). Hardwood is best gotten from Jaihri, hands down, and that'll help with the River Dams sidequest if you've been doing that.

### Balance Main Quest 1: Help From A Master

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Main Quest Highway:** Balance MQ1
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 3 Dí Bags
- **Rewards:** 1 Water Mask
- **Recommendations:** I know the Dí Bags seem endless, but this is the last hurrah in the main quest line. Maybe play around in Riza sidequests for a while if this takes too long to grind, or (better yet) explore Raina Expedition and its more-bountiful River Water sources. And once you finish the first few Balance quests, the range of monsters and sidequests available really opens up.

### Balance Main Quest 2: Underwater Training

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Main Quest Highway:** Balance MQ2
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Puna, 4 Sliv, and 3 Isartu
- **Rewards:** 3 Water Masks & 1 Underwater Torch
- **Recommendations:** This is where you start getting strategic about sidequests. There are a LOT of Battle sidequests in Balance. Heck, if you wanted, you could work on Gone Fishing AND any Puna sidequests you have left from Luciola or Gansu. You could work on River Landwalkers with the Isartu. Just remember that there are a LOT of Battle quests, and you won't be able to drop them from your Questbook and pick them up again. I would not prioritize any of the sidequests that dovetail with this one; unless you expect to be finishing them quickly, you'll have other uses for your quest slots. (OTOH if you're a fast completionist go ahead and save a couple battles by completing these now and getting ahead.)

### Balance Main Quest 3: The Deep Dark

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Main Quest Highway:** Balance MQ3
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 8 Nuig, 2 Xyplos, and 2 Vezi
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest
- **Recommendations:** This one I *would* look for sidequests that dovetail, because 8 Nuig battles are a pity to use for only one. (Although be warned that if you want to complete every sidequest, there will be more of these ahead that you simply can't double up well.) Also, don't spring for Underwater Torches unless you have to. If your Luck is >17, you'll usually get one back for each one you use in battle. You won't be able to queue Xyplos or Vezi with a single Underwater Torch, but you might be able to fight them all one at a time with the start from the Torch you won from the last quest. (And if you open any River Chests, they'll get you more Underwater Torches. For those who love to queue.)

### Balance Main Quest 4: Potion For A Goddess

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Main Quest Highway:** Balance MQ4
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 12 Nuig String, 25 River Grass, 4 Vezi Shell, and 50 Dust
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest
- **Recommendations:** If these requirements are difficult, you probably haven't done enough of the battle sidequests. Go ahead and revel in those a bit. Some involve a fair amount of traveling, but that's just a good reason to put them all together and do them at once. Anyway, there's only one Main Quest left in Balance after this, so you might as well pace yourself.

### Balance Main Quest 5: The Water Calls

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Main Quest Highway:** Balance MQ5
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat the River Goddess
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest, Lodo as Companion, open Dark Forest Outpost 
- **Recommendations:** WATCH YOUR EQUIPMENT. 5K words in 72 hours? It might be worth shelling out for a Reinforced Steel Helmet and Reinforced Steel Breastplate first.  Put them together with a Steel Mace, a Harpoon, Steel Boots, and a Stone Ring? It'll take 3,847 words in 3 days and 16 hours, 55 minutes (so almost 4 days). Get a Sands Ring instead of a Stone Ring? 3,817 words in 17 hours, 38 minutes. If you want to figure out the best combo of equipment based on what you have, I have a list of everything here:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BxL&#95;absfs8GyIiDwZRXuABNww43UbS1Qh&#95;dJPDMU3Ig/edit#gid=199447042 And remember, while this is a big one for those of us used to less than 1K per day, it's very doable if you give yourself enough time.

### DFO Main Quest 1/Ousting the Outpost

NOTE: To trigger the DFO Main Quests, you will have to pick up the first one as if it were a side quest. After that, they'll behave more normally.

- **Location:** Dark Forest Outpost
- **Main Quest Highway:** DFO MQ1
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Zanthei, 5 Ascre, and 5 Belasi
- **Rewards:** 1 Bone Key
- **Recommendations:** Make sure and pick up any dovetailing sidequests you can.

### DFO Main Quest 2/Rats, Wrong Way!

- **Location:** Dark Forest Outpost
- **Main Quest Highway:** DFO MQ2
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 3 Pickaxes, defeat 10 Takori, 11 Pakkan, and 12 Chu
- **Rewards:** 1 Bones Chest
- **Recommendations:** Remember that Pickaxes are in the Desert Expedition, if you didn't pick them up there the first time. And if you really hate travel, might be a good time to pick up 10 Kapir Tufts against the future.

### DFO Main Quest 3/The Right Way?

- **Location:** Dark Forest Outpost
- **Main Quest Highway:** DFO MQ3
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 15 Ardi Lamps
- **Rewards:** 1 Bone Key
- **Recommendations:** These are just the first 15 Ardi Lamps you'll need in the main questline; go ahead and pick up a full 25 while you're there, to save time. Remember that Ardi Lamps are in the Forest Expedition, in Forward Base. You might need to check out the Travel Directions section of the Guide to figure out how to unlock it if you haven't already. And while you're in the Forest, you might want to pick up the new sidequest that's just popped up in Luciola Forest. (And if you hate travel, DEFINITELY fight enough Kaija in Base Camp to get 20 Saliva Vials.)

### DFO Main Quest 4/Attacking The Darkness

- **Location:** Dark Forest Outpost
- **Main Quest Highway:** DFO MQ4
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 6 Osalyu and 12 Belasi
- **Rewards:** 1 Bones Chest
- **Recommendations:** Now's a good time to work on the Belasi sidequests! That would be Nasty, Dust Air here, and the sidequest that just popped up in Luciola Forest that I recommended you pick up in the last one. Though be forewarned that the Luciola quest requires 10 Nets, which are pretty expensive, and Belasi are pretty cheap to just fight twice if you don't want 10 Nets staring you down indefinitely.

### DFO Main Quest 5/ A Fox Untrusted

- **Location:** Dark Forest Outpost
- **Main Quest Highway:** DFO MQ5
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Dust Wignow, deliver 10 Ardi Lamps
- **Rewards:** 1 Bone Key
- **Recommendations:** Ardi Lamps again! Otherwise, totally straightforward.

### DFO Main Quest 6/ A Fox Untested

- **Location:** Dark Forest Outpost
- **Main Quest Highway:** DFO MQ6
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat Dust Rudakai
- **Rewards:** 1 Bones Chest
- **Recommendations:** If you've done any Steel Boots quests, congrats! You know how to get Fabric Boots! If you've done 3PC's Tailor sidequest, you might have a spare pair on hand! (And if you haven't, now you know where to get one.) Otherwise, you might want to check out mbrennan's Resource Calculation Spreadsheet to keep track of the Leaf Boots and Leafsung Ink you'll need to make Leafsung Boots to make Fabric Boots: https://4thewords.com/forum/thread-return-of-the-resource-calculation-spreadsheet

### DFO Main Quest 7/The True Reason

- **Location:** Dark Forest Outpost
- **Main Quest Highway:** DFO MQ7
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Papple
- **Rewards:** 1 Bone Key
- **Recommendations:** Sweet and straightforward after the last few.

### DFO Main Quest 8/Bound Up In

- **Location:** Dark Forest Outpost
- **Main Quest Highway:** DFO MQ8
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 2 Sacred Feathers, 20 Essence, 20 Saliva Vials, 10 Kapir Tufts, 10 Refined Dust, 10 River Water
- **Rewards:** 1 Bones Chest
- **Recommendations:** And we're back to complex. But apart from the Refined Dust, all the resources are in the earlier game, so my All Resources section should be able to help you find them.

### DFO Main Quest 9/Detect, Chain, Bind

- **Location:** Dark Forest Outpost
- **Main Quest Highway:** DFO MQ9
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat Miclan
- **Rewards:** 1 Bone Key
- **Recommendations:** So, Miclan requires 5 Steel Chains, 3 Pieces of Parchment, and 1 Blue Essence Ink to fight. If you've opened your Bone Chests so far, you should have enough for this. But at least none of these things are difficult to craft if need be. And you have three days to fight him!

### DFO Main Quest 10/A Dogged Search

- **Location:** Dark Forest Outpost
- **Main Quest Highway:** DFO MQ10
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Chaensi and 1 Lycosta
- **Rewards:** 1 Bones Chest
- **Recommendations:** Look! Lower requirements than Miclan! And again pretty straightforward.

### DFO Main Quest 11/To Hound Babu

- **Location:** Dark Forest Outpost
- **Main Quest Highway:** DFO MQ11
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Babu
- **Rewards:** 1 Bones Chest & 1 Bone Key
- **Recommendations:** Fewer requirements than Miclan, better quest rewards, and you get a good doggie!

### DFO Main Quest 12/ Well of Lost Souls

- **Location:** Dark Forest Outpost
- **Main Quest Highway:** DFO MQ12
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 25 Stone Blocks, 15 Reinforced Rope, 15 Sandstone Blocks, 15 Hardwood, and 10 Steel Bars
- **Rewards:** 1 Bones Chest & 1 Bone Key
- **Recommendations:**  Yes, it's a grind. Same as the end of several other regions. But it's a grind you know how to beat. And if you want to go pick up the new sidequest that lets you just battle Babu instead, it'll give you a shiny new Weapon1 with as much Attack as a Steel Mace (previous winner of Attack) and an additional 4 Luck.

### PG Main Quest 1/Then The Bird Said

NOTE: To trigger the PG Main Quests, you will have to pick up the first one as if it were a side quest. After that, they'll behave more normally.

- **Location:** Purple Gate
- **Main Quest Highway:** PG MQ1
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Poe, 5 Xaey, and 3 Cursed Hands
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Basic Boots Purple Gate https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1285-basic-boots-purple-gate-9102-70235.png
- **Recommendations:** Welcome to the Purple Gate, land of wardrobe rewards galore! There's very little in the way of resource-based gameplay here, so you won't need any guidance on that front; most of the monsters are quite straightforward, as well. So for most of these, my advice will be simple: up to you!

### PG Main Quest 2/A Desolate Path

- **Location:** Purple Gate
- **Main Quest Highway:** PG MQ2
- **Type:** Battle

- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Basic Pants Purple Gate https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1286-basic-pants-purple-gate-9104-70076.png

### PG Main Quest 7/Fighting the Water

- **Location:** Purple Gate
- **Main Quest Highway:** PG MQ7
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Dust Lodo
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Eninir Skeleton Ribs https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1068-ghoul-ribs-bodypaint-7673-91654.png
- **Recommendations:** Fight Dust Lodo as many times as you want before turning this in, because Dust Lodo is going to disappear after you move on.

### PG Main Quest 8/Fighting the Flame

- **Location:** Purple Gate
- **Main Quest Highway:** PG MQ8
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Dust Azadi
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Eninir Skeleton Neck https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1067-ghoul-neck-bodypaint-7671-62882.png
- **Recommendations:** Same for Dust Azadi as Dust Lodo. I'll mention that if I were going to sit around and grind indefinite Bones Chests and Bone Keys, this isn't where I'd do it.

### PG Main Quest 9/Fighting the Mountain

- **Location:** Purple Gate
- **Main Quest Highway:** PG MQ9
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Dust Suwö
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Dust Suwo Mouth https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1060-dust-suwo-mouth-7657-62115.png
- **Recommendations:** Noticing a trend? This still isn't where I'd camp out, but stick around as long as you want Dust Suwö sticking around.

### PG Main Quest 10/A Familiar Fight

- **Location:** Purple Gate
- **Main Quest Highway:** PG MQ10
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Dark Reflection
- **Rewards:** Unlock the Cave, and Wardrobe x2: Dark Hands Avatar https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1072-dark-avatar-hands-7681-26711.png and Dark Avatar Bodypaint https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1071-dark-avatar-bodypaint-7679-20341.png 
- **Recommendations:** Okay, last boss fight for the Purple Gate. And again, this will disappear once you turn it in. I'm not going to hearken back to the Dust Witch in Gansu and recommend you stick around indefinitely, because there are better places to camp later in the game (yes, there is a "later in the game" even as of the day Purple Gate dropped), but certainly feel free to stick around till you tire of battling your reflection.

### CAVE Main Quest 1/Meet the Shadow

- **Location:** Cave
- **Main Quest Highway:** CAVE MQ1
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 2 Sakot, 5 Vafire, and 3 Gliva
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Basic Boots Cave https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1284-basic-boots-cave-9100-78037.png 
- **Recommendations:** Remember how a lot of my Purple Gate recommendations were copy/paste, because the quests were so self-explanatory? Yeah, same applies for a lot of these. Keep an eye out for overlapping sidequests, and approach as you please.

### CAVE Main Quest 2/Talk with Shadow

- **Location:** Cave
- **Main Quest Highway:** CAVE MQ2
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Attwo, 8 Tacin, and 12 Chio

- **Recommendations:** Keep an eye out for overlapping sidequests, and approach as you please.

- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Smoke Eye Makeup https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1181-smoke-eye-makeup-8273-63331.png
- **Recommendations:** I'll tell you three important things about Ghost Suwö: 1) he is easily the easiest balanced source of Bones Chests/ Bone Keys in the entire game, 2) he disappears after this quest, but 3) he is far from your last chance to do this (unlike the Dust Witch and her Stone Chests and Stempos). Plan your time to turn in this quest accordingly.

### CAVE Main Quest 4/Discuss with Shadow

- **Location:** Cave
- **Main Quest Highway:** CAVE MQ4
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Olanat, 3 Letos, and 3 Gliva

- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Smoke Shoulder Makeup https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1179-smoke-shouldermakeup-8241-75896.png
- **Recommendations:** You can guess where this is going, right? Pattern inverting Purple Gate monsters, certain predictability? Notice that the Ghosts are getting progressively easier, where the Dust-infected companions got harder (but drops are inverting, too).

### CAVE Main Quest 6/Speak with Shadow

- **Location:** Cave
- **Main Quest Highway:** CAVE MQ6
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Spina and 5 Ulos
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Basic Shirt Cave https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1289-basic-shirt-cave-9110-94571.png

- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Cave Eyes https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1226-cave-eyes-8615-13259.png
- **Recommendations:** I will admit that the 500-word guaranteed Bones Chest drop is quite tempting, but if you keep on going, you can have (more expensive) Keys to match.

### CAVE Main Quest 8/The Final Fight

- **Location:** Cave
- **Main Quest Highway:** CAVE MQ8
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Reflection
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Translucid Chest https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1277-translucid-chest-8970-17166.png
- **Recommendations:** Guess what? REFLECTION STAYS. (And the crowds rejoiced!) You do NOT have to worry about milking them to the last drop. In fact, once you turn in this quest, you'll unlock a sidequest fighting Reflections, so don't fight more than one before turning this in.

### Amateur Fisherman - Riza

- **Location:** Riza Rivertown
- **Quest Path:** (open via Main Quest Highway Gansu MQ8/Dust to Dust) • **Amateur Fisherman** • Riza Apprentice Fisherman • Riza Water Tribe Stripes
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Patliadu
- **Rewards:** 25 Coins
- **Recommendations:** Completing this opens up another quest that can net you a Stone Key. Otherwise, it doesn't have anything to recommend it except a sense of satisfaction in Completing The Things. If you want to also do Battle Ready and/or Osaril Nests, do them first for maximum Harpoon efficiency.

### Apprentice Fisherman - Riza

- **Location:** Riza Rivertown

- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 8 Patliadu
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Key
- **Recommendations:** Go for it! If you're planning on doing Osaril Nests, though, make sure you do it first: the Harpoons will be helpful in the Patliadu battles. And do the Battle Ready quest first. You'll get to keep the Harpoons you gather for it, and can then use them on Patliadu.

- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Sharp Crystal Necklace https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1078-crystal-medium-length-necklace-7710-29407.png
- **Recommendations:** My recommendation for most Purple Gate sidequests is pretty uniform: take the quest if you like the reward, and you can figure out the rest!

### Au-some Frog Race - SacredS

####NOTE: Important Info in Recommendations

- **Location:** Raina Sacred Site

- **Unlocked by:** Raina Expedition Trail: SwampL Twisted Treacherous Trails (2/2)

- **Type:** Battle

- **Requirements:** Defeat 1000 Kuldoro

- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Kuldoro Pet https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;772-golden-frog-pet-5280-13978.png

- **Recommendations:** That's a lot of Kuldoro. Good thing you can work on the quest without picking it up.

  Repeat: as of this writing when the site opens up, this quest counts every Kuldoro you've ever battled, whether you were carrying the quest or not.

  So you are 100% free to pick this up and put it down at your convenience, same as a Collection quest.

  And congrats to Jess Mountifield for inspiring this quest with her ambitious self-challenge during the special event! https://4thewords.com/forum/thread-1000-gold-froggies/1

### Barge Weights - Riza

- **Location:** Riza Rivertown
- **Unlocked by:** Riza MQ6/Journey Upriver
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Gather 35 River Stones
- **Rewards:** 2 Stone Keys
- **Recommendations:** Grab it! The Floating City of Balance has places to get River Stones more easily than Riza; it's worth the effort.

###Base Camp Clearing Duty  - HuntS1.2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Xuso, 10 Sacer, and 5 Kaija
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  This'll help you get the Saliva Vials for the Curator quest part 2, and dovetails well with Into Forest Depths.

###A Battle of Celebration - HuntS4

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail HuntS3 A Bubble Dream
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Morimet
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  Right now, this doesn't look like it actually does anything, since we have all the Hunt Map Pieces in hand; we'll see if that holds true once the Bard appears!

### Battle Experience - Gansu

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Unlocked by:** 3PC MQ5/A Way South
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Win 100 Battles Against Any Monster
- **Rewards:** 1 Protective Cloak & 2 Protective Mantles
- **Recommendations:** Might as well pick it up if you have a space open (you'll be fighting battles regardless), but it's no longer useful the way it used to be.

### Battle of Constitution (3/4) - HuntS1

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via Hunt Trail HuntS1 The Hunt Begins) • HuntS1 A Battle of Wills • HuntS1 Battle of Merit • **Battle of Constitution** • HuntS1 A Battle of Evolution
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Velts: Water
- **Rewards:** 15 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** This is the first time the Battle chain has explicitly acknowledged being a chain. And yes, the chain will continue!

### A Battle of Evolution 4/4 - HuntS1

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via Hunt Trail HuntS1 The Hunt Begins) • HuntS1 A Battle of Wills • HuntS1 Battle of Merit • HuntS1 Battle of Constitution • **A Battle of Evolution** 
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Velts: Dust
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Battle Helmet https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;634-hunt-battle-helment-3693-42038.png (7 variants)
- **Recommendations:** Shockingly, Dust Velts is to be found in the Water Region, possibly enjoying Dí at Luko's Inn. As far as I can tell, this is the end of the quest chain, but this Velts has particularly nice drops (especially if you've recently opened Raina, or really any area beyond Riza).

### Battle of Merit - HuntS1

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via Hunt Trail HuntS1 The Hunt Begins) • HuntS1 A Battle of Wills • **Battle of Merit** • HuntS1 Battle of Constitution • HuntS1 A Battle of Evolution
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Velts: Desert
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Make sure you're fighting the 3PC version of Velts if you want to tackle this. She's tougher than the Mama Tree version, but doable enough.

### A Battle of Wills - HuntS1

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via Hunt Trail HuntS1 The Hunt Begins) • **A Battle of Wills** • HuntS2 Battle of Merit • HuntS1 Battle of Constitution • HuntS1 A Battle of Evolution
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Velts
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Velts is meant to be on the challenging side, and this launches her series of challenges roaming all around Oge-Mai. I highly recommend this series, because it's basically fighting Velts once in a bunch of places and getting a lot of bragging rights and some nice swag at the end. (Also, I'm particularly fond of the last Velts for niche Oh This Is So Great For This One Insanely Specific Thing reasons.) Note that you'll fight different Velts over different parts of the game, so you'll need to progress both in this quest and the main game to complete the chain.

### Battle Practice - Riza

- **Location:** Riza Rivertown
- **Unlocked by:** Gansu MQ8/Dust to Dust
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Trainees
- **Rewards:** 3 Stone Keys
- **Recommendations:** 1000 words in 60 minutes is no joke; doing it 10 times over is a real challenge. 3 Stone Keys are a really nice reward, though. I'd recommend picking this up, and if the pace is too punishing, write offsite and give yourself a little extra time. Trainee drops are good enough to make up for the extra effort, IMHO.

### Battle Ready - Riza

- **Location:** Riza Rivertown
- **Unlocked by:** Gansu MQ8/Dust to Dust
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Have at least 10 Harpoons in Inventory (and keep after turning in the quest!)
- **Rewards:** 25 Coins
- **Recommendations:** Do it. You get to keep the Harpoons, you will almost certainly want the Harpoons for hunting Patliadu at some point, and they're great Weapon2s anyway. If you do the Osaril Nests first, though, you'll get a couple Harpoons that way.

### Bettering Ourselves - HuntS3

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Hunt Trail Route:** (unlocked via LF MQ4/Don't Regift Curses) • MT The Winding Path to Elder Library • HuntS1 Joining the Hunt • HuntS1 The Hunt Begins • HuntS1 Deeper Forest Hunting • HuntS1 A Past Not Forgotten • HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library • HuntS2 All Who Wander • HuntS2 Oh, Endless Possibilities! • HuntS2 No Wrong Path • Hunt S2 Stumbling Upon Sheep • HuntS3 To Grow & Change • **Bettering Ourselves** • HuntS3 Bigger & Brighter • HuntS3 A Bubble Dream • HuntS4 Dirt to Dust • HuntS4 Celebrate Joy • HuntS4 Still Missing Something • HuntS4 Proving Your Friendship
- **Type:** Collection, Streak
- **Requirements:** Collect Hunt Map Piece 8 & reach a 5-day Streak
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Complex Brooch https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;651-hunt-complex-brooch-3813-44800.png
- **Recommendations:** The Season of Growth is certainly encouraging us to build our Streaks!

### Beware! Rock Shower - Shrine TFA

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Terror From Above Shrine Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 50 Arir
- **Rewards:** 10 Shrine Stones and Wardrobe: Alien Rock Shoulderpads https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;featured&#95;alien&#95;rock&#95;shoulderpads.png
- **Recommendations:** Slightly tedious, but it only takes 5K words to beat. You can do it!

### Bigger and Brighter - HuntS3

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Hunt Trail Route:** (unlocked via LF MQ4/Don't Regift Curses) • MT The Winding Path to Elder Library • HuntS1 Joining the Hunt • HuntS1 The Hunt Begins • HuntS1 Deeper Forest Hunting • HuntS1 A Past Not Forgotten • HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library • HuntS2 All Who Wander • HuntS2 Oh, Endless Possibilities! • HuntS2 No Wrong Path • Hunt S2 Stumbling Upon Sheep • HuntS3 To Grow & Change • HuntS3 Bettering Ourselves • **Bigger & Brighter** • HuntS3 A Bubble Dream • HuntS4 Dirt to Dust • HuntS4 Celebrate Joy • HuntS4 Still Missing Something • HuntS4 Proving Your Friendship
- **Type:** Collection, Streak
- **Requirements:** Collect Hunt Map Piece 9 & reach a 5-day Streak
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Facepaint Trident https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;665-hunt-facepaint-trident-4021-27616.png
- **Recommendations:** Still streaking! (Sorry, couldn't resist.) And as of this writing, still waiting to see what gets unlocked next by this one! But the Caretaker will almost certainly require this quest to unlock.

### Biodome Blossoms - Balance

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Unlocked by:** Balance MQ2: Underwater Training
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 15 Vezi Shells
- **Rewards:** 1 Reinforced Steel Helmet
- **Recommendations:** You'll probably have to fight 6 Vezi for this, and it's still easily the cheapest way to get a Reinforced Steel Helmet, which has great stats. DOOOO IIIIT. If you're grinding this before Main Quest 4, though, make sure you get 19 Vezi Shells, not 15. You'll be glad you did.

### Birb's the Word - ShrineBird

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Birds Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each:
  - Gayol
  - Noasis
  - Peq
  - Ralbone
  - Katock
- **Rewards:** 25 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** I love the pretty birds. I think they're all awesome. Basically, if you don't like this quest, it's probably a sign this isn't the Shrine Bracelet for you.

### Birbs of a Feather - DigS

- **Location:** Dig Site
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Gansu Digging Into Desert Sands
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 15 Rif
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest
- **Recommendations:** STONE CHEST. DO. (Just bear in mind that it pairs well with an Underground Ruins quest, so you might want to be in Ruins first.)

### Bite My Boots! - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** DFO MQ12/Well of Lost Souls
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 10 Dark Forest Boots
- **Rewards:** 25 Leafsung Ink
- **Recommendations:** This is really easy if you can get your hands on a dozen or so Bones Chests & Keys, whether through quest rewards or whatever. If all else fails, Miclan drops both Bones Chests & Bone Keys. And all the lovely Leafsung Ink!

### Biweekly: Monster Hunter

- **Location:** Global
- **Route:** none needed; globally available from the start
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Battle 20 Monsters of any kind
- **Rewards:** 1 Leafsung Key (used starting in the 3rd region; collect all you can when you can)
- Renews approx. 72 hours after delivery

### Blobby was Here - ShrinGO

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Green Ooze Shrine Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Giant Oozes
- **Rewards:** 10 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** This is a pretty small reward for the battles involved, but on the upside, you *also* get the rewards for battling the Giant Oozes on the way.

### Blossom with Flowers! (1/2) - FB

- **Location:** Forward Base
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via Forest Expedition Trail: BC Hard Day's Walk) • FB **Blossom with Flowers! 1/2** • GL Bright Night Blossoms 2/2
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Dandeleon (220 words in 30 min)
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Key
- **Recommendations:** Go for it! It's fun! It's easy! It's on the path to a nice crown!

### Bone To Pick - DFO

- **Location:** Dark Forest Outpost
- **Unlocked by:** Balance MQ5/The Water Calls
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 40 Burhar
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Dark Forest Shoulder Pads https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;darkforest&#95;shoulders.png
- **Recommendations:** One major upside: Burhar drop Steel Chains, which are very useful later in the area, so this is a good way to double up grinding with a quest. 40 is overkill for that purpose, though. It's up to you.

### A Bone to Pick - CAVE

- **Location:** Cave
- **Unlocked by:** CAVE MQ 4/Discuss with Shadow
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Sakot and 10 Letos
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Letos Ear Piercing https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1235-fishskull-medium-earpiercing-8675-13088.png
- **Recommendations:** This gets a boilerplate "sure, if you like! Maybe keep an eye out for overlaps?"

### Bone White Canvas - ShrineMar

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Marionette Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Zosimos
- **Rewards:** 25 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** None needed

### Boots Made For Climbing - TT

- **Location:** Tall Trees
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: FB Javelin Toss West
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Buholi, 1 Buhini, and 1 Buhovi; deliver 25 Leaves and 1 Leafsung Boots
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest, 1 Wooden Key, 1 Stempo
- **Recommendations:** Leafsung Boots are awfully valuable things to lose. But this is a pretty nice reward, especially if you don't have any Stempos yet.

### Bounding Over Dunes - DigS

- **Location:** Dig Site
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Gansu Digging Into Desert Sands
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 6 Bevrex
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest & 1 Stone Key
- **Recommendations:** WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME. 1800 words for a Stone Chest AND a Stone Key? DOOO IT. (Possibly alongside another quest in Ruins. You'll see.)

### Breaking Down Bones - PG

- **Location:** Purple Gate
- **Unlocked by:** DFO MQ12/Well of Lost Souls
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 50 Xaey
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Crystal Choker https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1077-crystal-choker-7698-94910.png
- **Recommendations:** My recommendation for most Purple Gate sidequests is pretty uniform: take the quest if you like the reward, and you can figure out the rest!

### Bridge for the Future - CAVE

- **Location:** Cave
- **Unlocked by:** PG MQ 10/A Familiar Fight
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 15 Hardwood, 15 Reinforced Rope, and 10 Steel Bars
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Tacin Crown https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1224-bat-wing-crown-8611-11380.png
- **Recommendations:** This gets a boilerplate "sure, if you like! Maybe keep an eye out for overlaps?"

### Bridge of Sighs - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** MT MQ4 / Aid To An Elder
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 100 Wood and 50 Rope
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendation:** I'd recommend trying to make sure you still have a supply of 100 Wood and 100 Rope even after being done with this, so I wouldn't pick this up till you have close to 200 Wood and 150 Rope in stock. The rewards aren't worth nearly as much as the cost, but just finishing another quest can be satisfying.

### Bright Night Blossoms (2/2) - GL

Note: technically, this appears as soon as you open Guardian's Lair whether you've completed the previous quest or not. But since you can't pick it up until the other one is completed, I'm counting this as a quest path.

- **Location:** Guardian's Lair
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via Forest Expedition Trail: BC Hard Day's Walk) • FB Blossom with Flowers! 1/2 • **Bright Night Blossoms (2/2)** 
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Night Dandeleons (and already have Blossom With Flowers from Forward Base completed)
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Dandeleon Crown
- **Recommendations:** It's a cute crown and they're cute monsters! Who only come out at night. ("Night" apparently starts at 18:00 where I am; I'm not sure how much of that calculates Daylight Savings or not. From others, I suspect it's 19:00 without Daylight Savings.)

### A Bubble Dream - HuntS3

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Hunt Trail Route:** (unlocked via LF MQ4/Don't Regift Curses) • MT The Winding Path to Elder Library • HuntS1 Joining the Hunt • HuntS1 The Hunt Begins • HuntS1 Deeper Forest Hunting • HuntS1 A Past Not Forgotten • HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library • HuntS2 All Who Wander • HuntS2 Oh, Endless Possibilities! • HuntS2 No Wrong Path • Hunt S2 Stumbling Upon Sheep • HuntS3 To Grow & Change • HuntS3 Bettering Ourselves • HuntS3 Bigger & Brighter • **A Bubble Dream** • HuntS4 Dirt to Dust • HuntS4 Celebrate Joy • HuntS4 Still Missing Something • HuntS4 Proving Your Friendship
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Caretaker
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Cactus Sprite Pet https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;861-cactus-sprite-pet-6003-60430.png
- **Recommendations:** This is part of the trail to get through the Hunt. Note that the Caretaker is in Dark Forest Outpost...

### Buholi in the Sky - TT

- **Location:** Tall Trees
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: FB Javelin Toss West
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Buholi
- **Rewards:** 4 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** Notice that the requirements don't mention that you'll need to beat 2-3 Nezthai for every Buholi you want to fight. Pace yourself.

### Build a Biodome (3/4) - RLab

- **Location:** Research Lab
- **Quest Path:** (open via Alien Expedition Trail: SpaceS Orders to Repair) • RLab Set Creatures Free! (1/4) • RLab Create a Clearing (2/4) • **Build a Biodome (3/4)** • RLab Encourage an Ecosystem (4/4) • IN ANY ORDER [RLab Making Mellow Mowow  (*unlocks Mowow in Wilderness*)• RLab Sagacious Sincere Sabu (*unlocks Sabu in Wilderness*) • RLab Silkly Sleek Sulanica (*unlocks Sulanica in Wilderness*)• RLab Zappy Zazzy Xombri (*unlocks Xombri in Wilderness*)• RLab Zooty Zanutaki Zings (*unlocks Zanutaki in Wilderness*)]
- **Type:** Collection, Streak
- **Requirements:** 3-day Streak, and deliver 15 Steel Bars, 15 Glass Bars, and 15 Stone Blocks
- **Rewards:** 5 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** There are a lot of quests here that need no extra recommendations, so here's a boilerplate to say this is one of them. :)

### By the Pie! - ShrinePoly

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Polygon Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each:
  - Poly Aracnu
  - Poly Reenu
  - Poly Mawt
  - Poly Wignow
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Polygon Shirt https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;688-polygon-shirt-4357-75172.png
- **Recommendations:** None needed

### Calcium Vitamins - ShrineMar

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Marionette Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle, Streak
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Zosimalus, maintain 5-day streak
- **Rewards:** 25 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** None needed

### A Carnival Festival - ShrineCar

  - Upuchu
  - Thapiolo
  - Mahor
  - Fetezira

### Cast Out Castu - Balance

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Unlocked by:** Balance MQ1/ Help From A Master
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 25 Castu, Deliver 10 Reinforced Rope, 10 Hardwood, and 5 Steel
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest
- **Recommendations:** If you're going to do this, pair it with the Curious Traveler quest that unlocks after all the Main Quests. MUCH more efficient. Also, hopefully at that point you'll have gotten enough River Chests open to make Reinforced Rope a less-expensive requirement.

### Catching Glints of Sunrise - Hideout

- **Location:** Rebel Raina Hideout
- **Unlocked by:** Raina Expedition Trail: SacredS A Worthy Offering
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 25 Kivi
- **Rewards:** 100 Coins
- **Recommendations:** Exactly what it looks like, no special recommendation info needed. :)

### Celebrate Joy

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Hunt Trail Route:** (unlocked via LF MQ4/Don't Regift Curses) • MT The Winding Path to Elder Library • HuntS1 Joining the Hunt • HuntS1 The Hunt Begins • HuntS1 Deeper Forest Hunting • HuntS1 A Past Not Forgotten • HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library • HuntS2 All Who Wander • HuntS2 Oh, Endless Possibilities! • HuntS2 No Wrong Path • Hunt S2 Stumbling Upon Sheep • HuntS3 To Grow & Change • HuntS3 Bettering Ourselves • HuntS3 Bigger & Brighter • HuntS3 A Bubble Dream • HuntS4 Dirt to Dust • **Celebrate Joy** • HuntS4 Still Missing Something • HuntS4 Proving Your Friendship

- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Facepaint Eye Stroke https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm_666-hunt-facepaint-eye-stroke-4035-59139.png 
- **Recommendations:** We're continuing on, and we're gonna make it. Almost to the end of the Hunt Map Piece collecting/turning in!

###Celebrate Stories

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** HuntS4 Quest: Still Missing Something
- **Type:** Wordcount
- **Requirements:** Write 5000 words
- **Rewards:** 10 Core Crystals, 10 Reactions: Celebrate, 10 Reactions: For The Valley!
- **Recommendations:**  10 CORE CRYSTALS. FOR 5K WORDS. GET. THIS. NOW.

### Change To See - HuntS3

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS2 Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Yala
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** ... you'll complete this anyway if you complete Growth in Friendship, so it overlaps well. If you can't do Growth in Friendship because you haven't unlocked Raina, this is a nice consolation prize.

### Cheer Your Dedication - HuntS4

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail HuntS3 A Bubble Dream
- **Type:** Wordcount, Forum
- **Requirements:** Write 10,000 words and make 5 posts in the Forum
- **Rewards:** 15 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** I always recommend participating in the forum, and the 10K will happen as you go. Take it!

### Cleaning The House - ShrineGO

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Green Ooze Shrine Bracelet
- **Type:** Streak, Battle
- **Requirements:** Maintain a 5-day streak; defeat 5 Giant Ooze Houses
- **Rewards:** 25 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** I'm completionist; I'm doing this. And it's really not that hard.

### A Clue to the Past - Hunt S1

- **Location:** Elder Library 
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via Hunt Trail: HuntS1 Joining the Hunt) • **A Clue to the Past** • HuntS1 Elder Library Assistants • HuntS1 Elder Library Security
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Sassi
- **Rewards:** 5 Hunter Tokens & 1 Hunt Map Piece
- **Recommendations:** This is an absolute prerequisite for the Hunt Begins quest. That's almost beside the point for me, because I will be tracking down those Sassis like there's no tomorrow to raid the Token Store of all its goods, and this is a nice side benefit, but yeah: worth prioritizing a bit.

### Collector - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** LF MQ4
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Have 30 Unique Items
- **Rewards:** 8 Core Crystals
- **Recommendation:** Grab immediately. Core Crystals are not to be shunned, and all you have to do is have this sit in your Questbook till you've found enough different Items in your inventory to fill it. (This usually doesn't take long, just following the main course of the game.)

### Colorful, Vibrant Hallucinations - CAVE

- **Location:** Cave
- **Unlocked by:** PG MQ 10/A Familiar Fight
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 15 Gliva
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Mushroom Earrings https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1266-mushroom-earrings-8924-86461.png
- **Recommendations:** This gets a boilerplate "sure, if you like! Maybe keep an eye out for overlaps?"

### Colors to Die For - Balance

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Unlocked by:** Balance MQ2: Underwater Training
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 15 Xyplos Ink, 25 Red Dye, and 20 Leafsung Ink
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: River Dye Hair https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;featured&#95;siren&#95;hair&#95;blue.png
- **Recommendations:** Sooooo pretty, the reward. Sooo infuriatingly expensive, the Leafsung Ink. Go fight the River Goddess till she drops enough River Chests to drop all of it, or fight Arenica and Desert Rudakai until they drop enough Golden Chests and you've collected enough Leafsung Keys from biweekly quests, and yes, that's probably the easiest way; if you try to obtain Leafsung Ink by crafting it, that's 60 Claws, 60 Dust, 100 Essence, and 100 Spider Poison. Oh, and Spider Poison and Xyplos Ink are only available as drops, no shortcuts to purchase them. If you do want to do it that way, do the Venomous Villains quest; you'll probably get 20 or so Spider Poison as a side benefit from the necessary battles right there. Elemental Power will get you another 5. And then… well, good luck.

### A Colossal Quest - ShrineGiant

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Giants Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each:
  - Skuppa's Giant Marionette
  - Giant Dust Spirit
  - Untu Golem
  - Piachi
  - Guardian
  - Takra
  - Caravan
  - Mandias
- **Rewards:** 75 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** Pace yourself. The Untu Golem will be the most challenging if you write onsite - 12 minutes is not much time to write 500 words. The Caravan will be the most endurance-demanding for lower-output writers, although if you have a sufficiently high Defense (like, anything over 16) you'll have 4 days to write 5K words, and if you can scrape >+44 Defense it'll be 5 days.

### Cool Creature Highlights (2/3) - MT

Note: NOT POSSIBLE to complete till Dark Forest Outpost unlocked

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via LF MQ 4) • MT Warm Creature Highlights 1/3 • **Cool Creature Highlights 2/3** • MT Creature Colors & Highlights 3/3
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** 
  - Deliver:
    - 10 River Water
    - 25 Ardii Dust
    - 10 Lorsa Fur
    - 3 Xyplos Ink
    - 10 Dark Forest Leaves
  - Defeat:
    - 10 Gobkey
    - 5 Patliadu
    - 5 Xuso
    - 3 Vezi
- **Rewards:** 3 Bones Chests, 1 Bones Key
- **Recommendations:** You got past the first part - congrats! No mean feat. Now you'll get a key for your chests, and the Dark Forest Leaves have to come from the Dust. Good luck with the Xyplos Ink, too (remember Sliv can get it for you more easily than Xyplos if you have enough Luck), and good luck fighting the Vezi and good luck remembering that Gobkeys are way back in the Forest Expedition in Guardian's Lair. Go forth and conquer!

### A Coordinated Attack (1/2) - PG

- **Location:** Purple Gate
- **Quest Path:** (open via PG MQ4/A Ruined Path) • **A Coordinated Attack 1/2** • PG A Coordinated Attack 2/2

- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Steel Hands Necklace https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1211-steel-hands-necklace-8585-24205.png
- **Recommendations:** As of this writing, this quest's reward is the same as the reward for Main Quest 6, so weigh the value of this quest against the next quest in the sequence.

### A Coordinated Attack (2/2) - PG

- **Location:** Purple Gate
- **Quest Path:** (open via PG MQ4/A Ruined Path) • PG A Coordinated Attack 1/2 • **A Coordinated Attack 2/2**
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 25 Zhout and 10 Dark Assassins 
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Zhout Hands https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1065-ghoul-crystal-hands-7667-91750.png
- **Recommendations:** My recommendation for most Purple Gate sidequests is pretty uniform: take the quest if you like the reward, and you can figure out the rest!

### Crab Claw Clack - CAVE

- **Location:** Cave
- **Unlocked by:** CAVE MQ1/Meet the Shadow
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 25 Chio
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Spike Nose Ring https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1271-spike-nose-ring-8950-83364.png and Wardrobe: Fishbone Brow Piercing https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1232-fishskull-browpiercing-8647-74697.png
- **Recommendations:** This gets a boilerplate "sure, if you like! Maybe keep an eye out for overlaps?"

### Create a Clearing (2/4) - RLab

- **Location:** Research Lab
- **Quest Path:** (open via Alien Expedition Trail: SpaceS Orders to Repair) • RLab Set Creatures Free! (1/4) • **Create a Clearing (2/4)** • RLab Build a Biodome (3/4) • RLab Encourage an Ecosystem (4/4) • IN ANY ORDER [RLab Making Mellow Mowow  (*unlocks Mowow in Wilderness*)• RLab Sagacious Sincere Sabu (*unlocks Sabu in Wilderness*) • RLab Silkly Sleek Sulanica (*unlocks Sulanica in Wilderness*)• RLab Zappy Zazzy Xombri (*unlocks Xombri in Wilderness*)• RLab Zooty Zanutaki Zings (*unlocks Zanutaki in Wilderness*)]
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 7 Kolbs, 7 Oxie, 7 Erbor, and 4 Teraleo
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Rock Hair Earring https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1085-rock-hair-earring-7804-71278.png
- **Recommendations:** There are a lot of quests here that need no extra recommendations, so here's a boilerplate to say this is one of them. :)

### Create Your Path - PG

- **Location:** Purple Gate
- **Unlocked by:** DFO MQ12/Well of Lost Souls
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 25 Reinforced Ardi Lamps
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Eninir Facepaint https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1066-ghoul-facepaint-7669-16359.png
- **Recommendations:** Assuming you want to do this (Reinforced Ardi Lamps are expensive!), make sure you first complete the Reinforced Ardi Lamp Station quest in DFO (just the first quest is necessary, not the entire chain) to gain the ability to craft the lamps. Which require a LOT of resources from all over the game. Good luck!

### Creature Colors & Highlights (3/3) - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via LF MQ4) • MT Warm Creature Highlights 1/3 • MT Cool Creature Highlights 2/3 • **Creature Colors & Highlights 3/3** 
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** 
  - Deliver:
    - 5 Dandeleon Flower
    - 8 Nuig String
    - 10 Essence
    - 3 Sacred Feathers
    - 3 White Fur
  - Defeat:
    - 3 Suulan
    - 3 Arenica
    - 10 Kaija
    - 10 Scofin
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Pride River Dye Hair [https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;836-pride-siren-hair-5634-64111.png](https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;836-pride-siren-hair-5634-64111.png)
- **Recommendations:** Look at the lovely hair! Isn't it wonderful? I'd rec attacking the monsters first, because the Suulan and Arenica will drop some of what you need. Dandeleon Flowers only come from Dandeleons and Night Dandeleons in the Forest Expedition, though, so you may have to travel for those (get the Kaija and Scofin in Base Camp and Tall Trees respectively). For Nuig String, make sure you've fought all the Castu quests from Balance that you want to fight, because Castu are a great source of Nuig String and they're really popular in Balance quests.

### Crown of Rocks (2/2) - IC

- **Location:** Impact Crater
- **Quest Path:** (open via Alien Meteoroid Trail: 3PC A Way North: Up The Mountain) • IC One Rocky Start (1/2) • **Crown of Rocks (2/2)**

  - Nartha
  - Oxie
  - Krang
  - Rhan
  - Ipo
  - Erbor
  - Arir
  - Halix
  - Maesc
  - Brachi
  - Galatre
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Rock Crown https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1090-beetle-crown-7904-84955.png
- **Recommendations:** There are a lot of quests here that need no extra recommendations, so here's a boilerplate to say this is one of them. :)

### The Crystal Giants - PG

- **Location:** Purple Gate
- **Unlocked by:** PG MQ5/ What Lies Uncovered
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Infected Golems
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Golem Crystal Hair https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1064-golem-crystal-hair-7665-46839.png
- **Recommendations:** My recommendation for most Purple Gate sidequests is pretty uniform: take the quest if you like the reward, and you can figure out the rest!

### The Curator of Elder Library - HuntS1

- **Location:** Elder Library 
- **Hunt Trail Route:** (unlocked via LF MQ4/Don't Regift Curses) • MT The Winding Path to Elder Library • HuntS1 Joining the Hunt • HuntS1 The Hunt Begins • HuntS1 Deeper Forest Hunting • HuntS1 A Past Not Forgotten • **The Curator of Elder Library** • HuntS2 All Who Wander • HuntS2 Oh, Endless Possibilities! • HuntS2 No Wrong Path • Hunt S2 Stumbling Upon Sheep • HuntS3 To Grow & Change • HuntS3 Bettering Ourselves • HuntS3 Bigger & Brighter • HuntS3 A Bubble Dream • HuntS4 Dirt to Dust • HuntS4 Celebrate Joy • HuntS4 Still Missing Something • HuntS4 Proving Your Friendship
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4x the Curator of Elder Library
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Sassi Pet [https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;featured&#95;sassi&#95;pet.png](https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;featured&#95;sassi&#95;pet.png)
- **Recommendations:** HOW. HOW CAN YOU NOT. KITTY! (... and, y'know, unlocking subsequent Seasons of the Hunt. But. KITTY!)

###Curator's Catalog Cache 2/2  - HuntS1.2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Quest Path:** (open via Hunt Trail HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library) • HuntS1.2 Curator's Catalog Collections • **Curator's Catalog Cache 2/2**
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 5 each Nezthai Claws, Saliva Vials, Gobkey Trinkets, and Rusty Pendants
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  Huh, hadn't figured that there would be a series with these collection quests. (Note that when Part 1 came out, it wasn't labeled as such.) The Gobkey Trinkets are easy to get, and the Rusty Pendants will gradually accrue as you open chests in Mama Tree (with decent Luck); Saliva Vials are easy to farm but increasingly widely used, and Nezthai Claws are something you'll already need quite a few of to complete all the quests this round. But if that's not off-putting, go for it!

###Curator's Catalog Collections 1/2  - HuntS1.2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Quest Path:** (open via Hunt Trail HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library) • **Curator's Catalog Collections** • HuntS1.2 Curator's Catalog Cache 2/2
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 3 Essence, 1 Spider Poison, 3 Lorsa Fur, 1 Tambo Mane, and 5 Claws
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  This is mostly "put excess materials to good use", in my book; a lot of these materials will have been gathered with the quests to break into the Elder Library, so hurrah to that having a use for even experienced Hunt followers! (Also: chain, so weigh the benefits of the sequels.)

### Curator's Family - HuntS1

- **Location:** Elder Library 
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS1 A Past Not Forgotten
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each: Burocat, Sassi, Clawadin, Alnu
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Look, if you don't just want to battle fierce kitties till the cows come home, I don't understand you. But if that marvelous option doesn't appeal to you, then there's not much need to focus on this quest. Unlike the other assistant quests, this does not advance the game.

### Curious Traveler - Balance

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Quest Path:** (open via Balance MQ5/The Water Calls) • **Curious Traveler** • Balance Curious Traveler Part 2 • Balance Curious Traveler Part 3
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 20 Castu, 20 Awa, and 20 Xin
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest, unlock Part 2
- **Recommendations:** You're done with the main game anyway, right? This goes well with Cast Out Castu, and it goes along a quest line that keeps getting harder, but at least ends up with River Chests and really nifty goggles for your avatar.

### Curious Traveler Part 2 - Balance

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Quest Path:** (open via Balance MQ5/The Water Calls) • Balance Curious Traveler • **Curious Traveler Part 2** • Balance Curious Traveler Part 3
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 20 Sliv and 20 Isartu
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest, 1 River Key, unlock Part 3
- **Recommendations:** This is a good time to pair up with River Landwalkers, double your Isartu value. And no, this quest line doesn't get easier, so pace yourself.

### Curious Traveler Part 3 - Balance

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Quest Path:** (open via Balance MQ5/The Water Calls) • Balance Curious Traveler • Balance Curious Traveler Part 2 • **Curious Traveler Part 3** 
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 20 Vezi and 20 Xyplos
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Water Goggles
- **Recommendations:** Look at the pretty goggles! Looky! https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wm&#95;featured&#95;water&#95;googles.png Just think of that while you fight the monsters. Pick up The Abyss Stares Back if you haven't already and get two quests for the price of one. You can do it!!!

### A Cursed Couple - DFO

- **Location:** Dark Forest Outpost
- **Unlocked by:** DFO MQ10/A Dogged Search
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 25 Lycosta and 25 Chaensi
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Dark Forest Roots Belt https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;roots&#95;belt.png
- **Recommendations:** Obviously a long-term commitment, and obviously a wardrobe reward. If you need to grind for the resources to fight these monsters, Zanthei are practically Piece of Parchment farms with enough Refined Dust to help make Blue Essence Ink, and the act of fighting these monsters gives you all the Steel you'll need for Steel Chains.

### Cursed Violet Winds - PG

- **Location:** Purple Gate
- **Unlocked by:** PG MQ3/Keep Pushing Forward
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 6 Dusiri and 12 Ardid
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Dusiri Crown https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1061-dust-whirlwind-crown-7659-69330.png
- **Recommendations:** My recommendation for most Purple Gate sidequests is pretty uniform: take the quest if you like the reward, and you can figure out the rest!

### Cut the Strings - ShrineCar

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Carnival Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Roica and 2 Biironk
- **Rewards:** 15 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** Possibly the easiest quest in this event.

### Cute Confetti Cannons! - ShrineCO

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Colorful Ooze Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Afeppti
- **Rewards:** 25 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** They really are cute confetti cannons, aren't they? Up to you how interested you are!

### Dark Floating Materials (5/5) - Balance

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Quest Path:** (open via DFO MQ12/Well of Lost Souls) • LF Dark Luciola Materials (1/5) • MT Dark Tree Materials (2/5) • 3PC Dark Three Materials (3/5) • Dark Watering Materials (4/5) (Gansu quest) • **Dark Floating Materials (5/5)** 
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 20 Bones, 20 Steel Chains, 15 Refined Dust, and 5 vials Blue Essence Ink
- **Rewards:** 10 Dí Bags and 10 River Water
- **Recommendations:** At this point, I'm a little underwhelmed with the rewards (would have been overjoyed to get them during Riza), but hey. Dust Wignow will get you Refined Dust and Bones, Burhar will get you Steel Chains, and hopefully you can manage the rest.

### Dark Luciola Materials (1/5) - LF

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Quest Path:** (open via DFO MQ12/Well of Lost Souls) • **Dark Luciola Materials (1/5)** • MT Dark Tree Materials (2/5) • 3PC Dark Three Materials (3/5) • Dark Watering Materials (4/5) (Gansu quest) • Dark Floating Materials (5/5) (Balance quest)
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 15 Bones, 20 Rat Tail, 5 Blue Essence Ink
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest, 1 Wooden Key
- **Recommendations:** This quest chain is worth examining, but it's more of a long-term goal than a quick one. It's also distributed, with each quest picked up in a different area. Go ahead and look through the whole Dark [X] Materials quest chain to see what you like. Skull boots for your Wardrobe? Leafsung Keys? Dí Bags? Is it worth the Dark Forest Outpost stuff? Don't forget that Rat Tails are a side effect of working on the Pit of Nightmares quest!

### Dark Three Materials (3/5) - 3PC

- **Location:** Three Points Crossing
- **Quest Path:** (open via DFO MQ12/Well of Lost Souls) • LF Dark Luciola Materials (1/5) • MT Dark Tree Materials (2/5) • **Dark Three Materials (3/5)** • Dark Watering Materials (4/5) (Gansu quest) • Dark Floating Materials (5/5) (Balance quest)

- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Dark Forest Boots https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;featured&#95;darkforest&#95;boots.png
- **Recommendations:** See the pretties? Go ahead and try to collect for the next quest, too, before you do too much traveling around.

### Dark Tree Materials (2/5) - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Quest Path:** (open via DFO MQ12/Well of Lost Souls) • LF Dark Luciola Materials (1/5) • **Dark Tree Materials (2/5)** • 3PC Dark Three Materials (3/5) • Dark Watering Materials (4/5) (Gansu quest) • Dark Floating Materials (5/5) (Balance quest)
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 20 Bones, 10 Blue Essence, 15 Refined Dust, 20 Pieces of Parchment, 50 Rat Tails
- **Rewards:** 5 Leafsung Keys
- **Recommendations:** Same as I said for Dark Luciola Materials. I'm always overstocked on Golden Chests and understocked on Leafsung Keys, so this is heaven for me.

### Dark Watering Materials (4/5) - Gansu

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Quest Path:** (open via DFO MQ12/Well of Lost Souls) • LF Dark Luciola Materials (1/5) • MT Dark Tree Materials (2/5) • 3PC Dark Three Materials (3/5) • **Dark Watering Materials (4/5)**  • Dark Floating Materials (5/5) (Balance quest)
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 20 Vials Blue Essence Ink
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest, 1 Leafsung Key, 1 White Fur
- **Recommendations:** Obviously you'll have to come back to the Desert to spend this reward, but 3PC is lovely this time of year. You might need to gather Glass Bars before you head back to Gansu, and consider getting enough for 25 rather than just 20 Blue Essence Ink.

### A Darkened Forest - BC

- **Location:** Base Camp
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: MT New Adventurous Horizons
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Min Level 3, 25 Dust, 3 Leaf Boots, 5 Rope
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest and 1 Wooden Key
- **Recommendations:** As you please. Pretty obvious what the costs/benefits are.

### Dazzling Desert Colors - DigS

- **Location:** Dig Site
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Gansu Digging Into Desert Sands
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Zera, 1 Suulan, and 1 Arenica
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Zera Fur Necklace https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1123-zera-fur-necklace-8039-94110.png
- **Recommendations:** I find that necklace pretty irresistible, but YMMV. I also have a weakness for battling the pretty creatures.

### Dazzling Desert Diversity - HuntS2

- **Location:** Elder Library 
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat:
  - 3 Loi
  - 2 Sakish
  - 2 Zera
  - 1 Kapir
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** The Strengthening quest chain involves Kapir in Part 5, so if you're planning on doing both, try to overlap those. There's no rush on this quest; you can take it at whatever pace you please.

### Deeper Forest Hunting - HuntS1

- **Location:** Elder Library 
- **Hunt Trail Route:** (unlocked via LF MQ4/Don't Regift Curses) • MT The Winding Path to Elder Library • HuntS1 Joining the Hunt • HuntS1 The Hunt Begins • **Deeper Forest Hunting** • HuntS1 A Past Not Forgotten • HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library • HuntS2 All Who Wander • HuntS2 Oh, Endless Possibilities! • HuntS2 No Wrong Path • Hunt S2 Stumbling Upon Sheep • HuntS3 To Grow & Change • HuntS3 Bettering Ourselves • HuntS3 Bigger & Brighter • HuntS3 A Bubble Dream • HuntS4 Dirt to Dust • HuntS4 Celebrate Joy • HuntS4 Still Missing Something • HuntS4 Proving Your Friendship
- **Type:** Words, Streak, Level, Collection
- **Requirements:** Write 10K words, add 7 consecutive streak days, minimum level 3, Hunt Map Piece 2
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Full Body Scars https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;featured&#95;full#95;body&#95;scars.png
- **Recommendations:** Pick this up and let it simmer in the background. Words and streak will more or less take care of themselves. Besides, there's no knowing what might be unlocked next month in this quest sequence! You can get Hunt Map Piece 2 by completing Elder Library Assistants.

### Defeating a Droxa Drove - SurfaceC

- **Location:** Raina Surface Camp
- **Unlocked by:** Raina Expedition Trail: Raina Surface Camp (Riza quest)
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Droxa
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest, Wardrobe: Raina Gold Necklace https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;722-raina-gold-necklace-4742-87811.png
- **Recommendations:** I like the Raina Gold Necklace, personally, and a River Chest is always nice, and the Droxa make me feel rich. Go for it!

### Deliver With A Smile - DFO

- **Location:** Dark Forest Outpost
- **Unlocked by:** Balance MQ5/The Water Calls
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 15 each: Leafsung Ink, Spider Poison, Red Dye
- **Rewards:** 1 Dark Forest Amulet
- **Recommendations:** This is an Inventory item, an Accessory that gives you +10 Luck. Decide for yourself if it's worth it for you.

### A Desert Exploration - DigS

- **Location:** Dig Site
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Gansu Digging Into Desert Sands
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Kapir
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Tiny Boots
- **Recommendations:** You're going to want to have fought one Kapir sooner or later; why not five? And such stylish boots!

### Desert Rudakai - Gansu

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Unlocked by:** 3PC MQ5/A Way South
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 15 Desert Rudakai
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest & 1 Stone Key
- **Recommendations:** This is a no-brainer YES for me, bc Desert Rudakai are some of my favorites. More objectively, there is a sidequest at the end of the game that also involves 3 Desert Rudakai and it might be nice to postpone this if this involves more Desert Rudakai than you like. Still, it's a good cost/benefit ratio even now, if you have decent stocks of Leaf Boots and Leaves on hand. (I'm fighting a Desert Rudakai writing this. <3 )

### Dessti's New Home - DFO

- **Location:** Dark Forest Outpost
- **Unlocked by:** Balance MQ5/The Water Calls
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Gather 50 Hardwood, 15 Steel, 25 Reinforced Rope, and 100 Raw Fabric
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Dark Forest Pin https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;darkforest&#95;pin.png
- **Recommendations:** How much do you like that pin? It's lovely. It may or may not be worth 25 Reinforced Rope and 15 Steel and 50 Hardwood to you (though Raw Fabric is so cheap, it's no big to spend it). Take it or leave it, as you please!

### Dí Production - Riza

- **Location:** Riza Rivertown
- **Unlocked by:** Riza MQ6/Journey Upriver
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Gather 10 Dí Bags
- **Rewards:** 1 Stempo
- **Recommendations:** Do… do you really want to do this? It's up to you. When I repeat the game multiple times, it's pretty easy to scrounge up 6500 Coins to buy this and cash out. But there are so many cheaper ways to get Stempos, and so many better uses for the resources it takes to get Dí. Completionists only, and I'd save for later even then.

### Digging Into Desert Sands - Gansu

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Desert Expedition Trail:** (open via Gansu MQ8/Dust to Dust) • **Digging Into Desert Sands** • DigS Question to Axe • IN ANY ORDER: [ Ruins Searching South • Ruins Navigating North • Ruins Withdrawing West • Ruins Excavating East ] • Ruins Tunnel Locked On • (access to Shrine of Ages)
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Wetu, be Min Level 8
- **Rewards:** Open Dig Site
- **Recommendations:** DO IT. So worth it. Expedition is always fun.

### Dirt to Dust - HuntS4

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Hunt Trail Route:** (unlocked via LF MQ4/Don't Regift Curses) • MT The Winding Path to Elder Library • HuntS1 Joining the Hunt • HuntS1 The Hunt Begins • HuntS1 Deeper Forest Hunting • HuntS1 A Past Not Forgotten • HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library • HuntS2 All Who Wander • HuntS2 Oh, Endless Possibilities! • HuntS2 No Wrong Path • Hunt S2 Stumbling Upon Sheep • HuntS3 To Grow & Change • HuntS3 Bettering Ourselves • HuntS3 Bigger & Brighter • HuntS3 A Bubble Dream • **Dirt to Dust** • HuntS4 Celebrate Joy • HuntS4 Still Missing Something • HuntS4 Proving Your Friendship
- **Type:** Streak, Collection
- **Requirements:** Have Hunt Map Piece 10 and attain 5-day Streak
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Golden Brooch https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;652-hunt-golden-brooch-3827-31075.png
- **Recommendations:** What's to lose by picking it up? And it lets you continue with the Hunt!

### A Distant Figure - HuntS2

- **Location:** Elder Library 
- **Quest Path:** (open via Hunt Trail: HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library) • HuntS2 Guarding the Path • HuntS2 State of Rest • **A Distant Figure** 
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Lubu
- **Rewards:** Hunt Map Piece 6, 5 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** You know the drill by now. Defeat the Ancient's assistant, get the Hunt Map Piece. Don't forget to pick up and turn in No Wrong Path after you're done with this.

### Double the Rarity - 3PC

- **Location:** Three Points Crossing
- **Unlocked by:** Gansu MQ8/Dust to Dust
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Get 12 Sacred Feathers and 12 White Fur
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest
- **Recommendations:** Only if you really want to. This almost is more of a "Battle" quest, because the only way to get Sacred Feathers is by battling Arenica, and Suulan is the only source of White Fur till after the Water Region. And unless your Luck is low, you'll get 12 Golden Chests dropped during these battles apart from the quest rewards. The Sacred Feathers and White Fur are more useful to craft Stempos, but hey, mileage varies.

### Drilling Too Deep - MSite

- **Location:** Mining Site
- **Unlocked by:** Alien Expedition Trail: SpaceS Technology & Dinti
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Arren & 2 Deepo
- **Rewards:** 3 Stempos & Wardrobe: Miner Hat https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;miner&#95;helmet&#95;light&#95;off.png
- **Recommendations:** There are a lot of quests here that need no extra recommendations, so here's a boilerplate to say this is one of them. :)

### Dry Stale Air CAVE

- **Location:** Cave
- **Unlocked by:** CAVE MQ3/Sharpening Stubborn Stones
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Tacin and 5 Fosfa
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Tacin Ribcage https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1259-corset-8906-74625.png
- **Recommendations:** This gets a boilerplate "sure, if you like! Maybe keep an eye out for overlaps?"

### Dust Mote Swarms - PG

- **Location:** Purple Gate
- **Unlocked by:** PG MQ2/A Desolate Path
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 100 Ardid
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Extended Chain Earrings https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1189-chain-earrings-elfears-8369-40440.png
- **Recommendations:** My recommendation for most Purple Gate sidequests is pretty uniform: take the quest if you like the reward, and you can figure out the rest!

### A Dusted Experiment - LF

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Unlocked by:** DFO MQ1/Ousting the Outpost
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 20 Belasi, collect 10 Nets, collect 10 Reinforced Rope
- **Rewards:** 3 Leafsung Ink
- **Recommendations:** If you're gonna do it, pick it up as soon as it appears and dovetail it with Nasty, Dust Air. But there are better ways to get Leafsung Ink these days (such as the Mama Tree Bite My Boots! quest...)

###Dynamic Disappearing Duo  - HuntS1.2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 2 Rudakai and 2 Wignow
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  At the moment, I'd say the quest needs to be evaluated on aesthetic grounds, because on mercenary grounds it's useless, but it's kinda fun to beat up on the monsters that steal boots in the lore (Wignow) as well as the monsters that actually cost boots to fight (Rudakai).

### Eat the Leaves? - GL

- **Location:** Guardian's Lair
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: FB North: Homeward Bound
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Maikile & 10 Wignow
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Leaf Necklace [https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1010-leaf-necklace-7448-12835.png](https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1010-leaf-necklace-7448-12835.png)
- **Recommendations:** As this quest unlocks, I'm a long, long way past my first time in the Forest. And this quest makes me nostalgic for that time. So I'm biased in its favor. Objectively, it's worth as much as you like that Leaf Necklace (and multitasking on Wignow quests, if you have any left).

### Edrie's Informative Lorsa - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** MT MQ1 / To Great Heights
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect/Craft 10 Lorsa Nests
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendation:** Not really my cup of tea, but up to you. Be aware that there are quests identical to this one with different names later on, so it might be worth it to think in terms of "do I want to craft 30 Lorsa Nests or not". 

### Eensy Weensy Oncara - PG

- **Location:** Purple Gate
- **Unlocked by:**  PG MQ1/Then The Bird Said
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 12 Oncara
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Crystal Necklace https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1030-crystal-necklace-7561-86961.png
- **Recommendations:** My recommendation for most Purple Gate sidequests is pretty uniform: take the quest if you like the reward, and you can figure out the rest!

### Elder Library Assistants - HuntS1

- **Location:** Elder Library 
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via Hunt Trail: HuntS1 Joining the Hunt) • HuntS1 A Clue to the Past • **Elder Library Assistants** • next step: HuntS1 Elder Library's Security
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Alnu
- **Rewards:** Hunt Map Piece 2, 5 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Pick up as soon as you have Forest Expedition open and can get to Alnu wandering around there. Nothing to lose!

### Elder Library's Security - HuntS1

- **Location:** Elder Library 
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via Hunt Trail: Hunt S1 Joining the Hunt) • HuntS1 A Clue to the Past • HuntS1 Elder Library Assistants • **Elder Library's Security** 
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Clawadin
- **Rewards:** 5 Hunter Tokens, 1 Hunt Map Piece 3
- **Recommendations:** May the Force be with you against these fierce guardians.

### Elemental Power - Balance

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Unlocked by:** Balance MQ1/ Help From A Master
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Illi, 5 Kiru, 5 Reenu, 5 Xin, and 5 Nuig
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest
- **Recommendations:** For those counting at home, this is a minimum of 4 Areas in 3 Regions (Reenu are available only in Luciola, Illi in Mama Tree, Kiru at this point in 3PC, and Nuig in Balance, with Xin everywhere). Which makes it pair really well with Venomous Villains, which also involves a lot of travel and Nuig. I personally like the excuse to travel and battle, but YMMV. And while you're traveling, consider those 5 Lorsa Nests for the Scouting Lorsa quest.

### Encourage an Ecosystem (4/4) - RLab

- **Location:** Research Lab
- **Quest Path:** (open via Alien Expedition Trail: SpaceS Orders to Repair) • RLab Set Creatures Free! (1/4) • RLab Create a Clearing (2/4) • RLab Build a Biodome (3/4) • **Encourage an Ecosystem (4/4)** • IN ANY ORDER [RLab Making Mellow Mowow  (*unlocks Mowow in Wilderness*)• RLab Sagacious Sincere Sabu (*unlocks Sabu in Wilderness*) • RLab Silkly Sleek Sulanica (*unlocks Sulanica in Wilderness*)• RLab Zappy Zazzy Xombri (*unlocks Xombri in Wilderness*)• RLab Zooty Zanutaki Zings (*unlocks Zanutaki in Wilderness*)]
- **Type:** Collection, Streak
- **Requirements:** 15-day Streak, and deliver: 
  - 5 Lorsa Fur - found in Mama Tree
  - 15 Raw Fabric
  - 10 Rope
  - 20 River Grass
  - 10 Wood
  - 15 River Water - Water Region, especially Raina Expedition
  - 30 Leaves
  - 3 Vezi Shell - Floating City of Balance, midway through Main Quests
  - 5 Ardii Dust - easiest to find in Forward Base
  - 5 Dinti
  - 5 Saliva Vials - Base Camp
  - 5 Feathers - easiest to find in the Forest Region
- **Rewards:** none listed; unlocking quests to unlock experimental monsters (and 1 Coin, per experimental results)
- **Recommendations:** That is a long shopping list. I hope you can find Dinti without my labeling it (you're IN the Alien Meteoroid Expedition after all), and many of the items are very common, but I've added locations to find the more obscure resources.

### Energy Now, Tired Later - SurfaceC

- **Location:** Raina Surface Camp
- **Raina Expedition Trail Route:** (open via Main Quest Highway Riza MQ6/Journey Upriver) • Riza Raina Surface Camp • **Energy Now, Tired Later** • SwampL Wading Through & Onwards (1/2) • SwampL Twisted Treacherous Trails (2/2) • SacredS A Worthy Offering
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Begala and 10 Rea &Pira
- **Rewards:** Unlock Swamplands, Wardrobe: Golden Nose Piercing https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;780-golden-nose-piercing-5300-55800.png
- **Recommendations:** This is what unlocks the next area in Raina Expedition; I'd go for it.

### Enter Pan's Labyrinth - LF

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Unlocked by:** 3PC MQ5/A Way South
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Get 20 Wood Hammers, 10 Rope, 3 Steel Bars
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest & 1 Wooden Key
- **Recommendations:** Great way to use extra Xin and Awa materials if you like Xin and Awa. (I don't, so for me Wood Hammers are waaaayyy too expensive to make this quest worth the grind.) Save for when you're between more compelling quests.

### Every Tunnel Connects - Ruins

- **Location:** Underground Ruins
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: DigS Question to Axe
- **Type:** Streak
- **Requirements:** Get a 10-day Streak
- **Rewards:** 4 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** I'm getting this for the easy Stempos. And the suspicion that this might unlock something else later...

### Excavating East - Ruins

- **Location:** Underground Ruins
- **Desert Expedition Trail:** (open via Gansu MQ8/Dust to Dust) • Gansu Digging Into Desert Sands • DigS Question to Axe • IN ANY ORDER: [ Ruins Searching South • Ruins Navigating North • Ruins Withdrawing West • **Excavating East**] • Ruins Tunnel Locked On • (access to Shrine of Ages)
- **Type:** Words, Battle
- **Requirements:** Write 450 words, defeat 1 Gordi
- **Rewards:** 5 Raw Stone
- **Recommendations:** Do it! Make sure you have the other directional quests at the same time, so you're not duplicating effort on wordcount.

### Explore the City - 3PC

- **Location:** Three Points Crossing
- **Unlocked by:** MT MQ4
- **Type:** Streak
- **Requirements:** Maintain a 5 day Streak, starting with the day you pick up the quest
- **Rewards:** 1 Gold Bar & 1 Glass Bar
- **Recommendations:** Go ahead and pick it up immediately! Nothing to lose, a Gold Bar and Glass Bar to gain. This is currently the only Streak quest in the game, too.

### Fair, Standard, Middling - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** LF MQ4
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 25 Nitana, 25 Castu, 25 Rulo, 25 Illi, and 25 Tylu (all 400-700 word monsters)
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Expedition Tylu Belt
- **Recommendations:** This is a long-term quest that can't be completed until you get halfway through the main quest sequence in the Floating City of Balance, which is a long ways away. These monsters are all over Oge-Mai, not just the Forest Region. If you want to pick up the quest now so that any battles you have against the appropriate creatures count, go ahead; however, this may be worth saving until you run out of other things to do in the entire game, especially since the only reward is essentially bragging rights and a wardrobe item.

###Familiar Assistants Needed!  - HuntS1.2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 each Sassi, Alnu, Burocat, and Clawadin
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Aging Beard https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1526-hunt-aging-beard-10389-52135.png
- **Recommendations:**  This one REALLY feels like an optional sidequest!

### Familiar Family Friends - DFO

- **Location:** Dark Forest Outpost
- **Unlocked by:** Balance MQ5/The Water Calls
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat:
  - 5 Wignow
  - 5 Desert Wignow
  - 5 Dust Wignow
  - 5 Nezthai
  - 5 Zanthei
  - 5 Sacer
  - 5 Ascre
  - 5 Belasi
  - 5 Reenu
  - 1 Dust Rudakai
  - 1 Desert Rudakai
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Dark Forest Roots Bracers https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;roots&#95;braces.png
- **Recommendations:** Go ahead and pick it up and hold onto it if you have space. Obviously this is a long-term commitment! But some of it will take care of itself as you go. (Notice that three of the five monster requirements are going to be knocked out by the first Main Quest. Go on, grab it!)

### A Family Tree - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** LF MQ4
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Battle 8 Tylu
- **Rewards:** 50 Coins, 1 Wood Spear, 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendation:** Take this one and knock it out! The Wood Spear is a nice weapon to have on hand at this stage.

### Fan the Flames - 3PC

- **Location:** Three Points Crossing
- **Unlocked by:** MT MQ4
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 100 Wood and 50 Leaves
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest and 3 Leafsung Keys
- **Recommendations:** Leafsung Keys are really, really valuable; apart from the Bi-weekly Monster Hunter quests, there aren't many in the game. If you like Xin and Awa, this is a cinch for something to Do Immediately. If not, it's still something to prioritize, but DO NOT PURCHASE WOOD OR LEAVES FOR THIS. Grind them all you want, but 3PC's main quests require over 1000 Coins; it's unlikely that you can spare any.

### Feathers & Fur - Ruins

- **Location:** Underground Ruins
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: DigS Question to Axe
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Bevrex and 5 Rif
- **Rewards:** 3 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** Did you wait on the Birbs of a Feather and Bounding Over Dunes in Dig Site? Because if you have this in you Questbook, it'll automatically finish while you do the other two. If not, it's still a fairly easy way to get 3 Stempos.

### Feeding the Lighthouse - FB

- **Location:** Forward Base
- **Forest Expedition Trail Route:** (open via MT MQ4 / Aid To An Elder) • MT New Adventurous Horizons •  BC Hard Day's Walk • **Feeding the Lighthouse** • IN ANY ORDER [FB Javelin Toss West • FB North: Homeward Bound • FB Stone's Throw East]
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 25 Ardia, 25 Ardii, and 25 Ardis
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest, 1 Ardi Lamp
- **Recommendations:** Well, you can't advance until you First Stempo - Gansu
  - **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
  - **Quest Path:** (open via Gansu MQ8) • Gansu Rebuild the Watering Hole • Gansu Respark the Flame • Gansu Local Shrine • **First Stempo** • (ability to craft Stempos), MT Study Break Time
  - **Type:** Collection
  - **Requirements:** Collect 10 Essence, 1 Glass, 1 Gold, 1 Sacred Feather, 1 White Fur
  - **Rewards:** 1 Stempo, and ability to craft them
  - **Recommendations:** This is actually exactly what it says on the tin: the first Stempo you craft. These ingredients will reliably get you one Stempo every time after this, when it becomes a craftable item in Crafts & Trinkets/Wynfri of Water. So you can actually postpone this quest till you want more Stempos, if you want, but the sooner you get it out of the way, the sooner you can craft them in batches.
- complete this, anyway. Plus, Ardi* beasts are fun to battle.

### Fetch! Play! Battle! - DFO

- **Location:** Dark Forest Outpost
- **Unlocked by:** DFO MQ11/To Hound Babu
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Babu
- **Rewards:** 1 Dark Forest Sword
- **Recommendations:** Whoza good boy? Babu's gonna get you a Dark Forest Sword, which has as much Attack as any other Weapon1 and more Luck than the Steel Mace that ties it. I like this quest.

### Fighters, Friends, Foes - ShrineCar

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Carnival Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 2 Fetezira
- **Rewards:** 20 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** None needed! Pretty straightforward.

### Fighting Fallen Soldiers (1/2) - CAVE

- **Location:** Cave
- **Quest Path:** (open via CAVE MQ 5/It was Like Lightning) • **Fighting Fallen Soldiers 1/2** • CAVE Fighting Fallen Soldiers 2/2
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Gormist & 10 Olanat
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Olanat Hair https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1220-mushroom-hat-8603-56013.png
- **Recommendations:** This gets a boilerplate "sure, if you like! Maybe keep an eye out for overlaps?"

### Fighting Fallen Soldiers (2/2) - CAVE

- **Location:** Cave
- **Quest Path:** (open via CAVE MQ 5/It was Like Lightning) • CAVE Fighting Fallen Soldiers 1/2 • **Fighting Fallen Soldiers 2/2**

- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Tainted Sword https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1274-sword-8958-92313.png
- **Recommendations:** This gets a boilerplate "sure, if you like! Maybe keep an eye out for overlaps?"

### First Stempo - Gansu

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Quest Path:** (open via Gansu MQ8) • Gansu Rebuild the Watering Hole • Gansu Respark the Flame • Gansu Local Shrine • **First Stempo** • (ability to craft Stempos), MT Study Break Time
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 10 Essence, 1 Glass, 1 Gold, 1 Sacred Feather, 1 White Fur
- **Rewards:** 1 Stempo, and ability to craft them
- **Recommendations:** This is actually exactly what it says on the tin: the first Stempo you craft. These ingredients will reliably get you one Stempo every time after this, when it becomes a craftable item in Crafts & Trinkets/Wynfri of Water. So you can actually postpone this quest till you want more Stempos, if you want, but the sooner you get it out of the way, the sooner you can craft them in batches.

### First Steps

see **Lead the Way**

### Flutters Shy & High (4/4) - DFO

- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Gordiliani Spirit Pet https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;gordi&#95;butterfly&#95;pet.png
- **Recommendations:** Gotta go to Ruins for Gordiliani, and as soon as you finish this quest Spirit Griffes appear alongside them. Maybe check out Balance after that. And enjoy your adorable, adorable Gordiliani Spirit Pet.

### Flying Past Sparks - HuntS3

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS2 Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Nuig
- **Rewards:** Hunt Map Piece 8, 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** The Season of Growth seems to be favoring us with a gentler way to obtain Hunt Map Pieces so far - we do NOT need to complete Moving Flora to unlock this quest. Still, we do need to complete this one to continue on the Hunt Map Pieces chain, so let's dig in.

### Fool Me Once - ShrineFools

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Fools' Time Bracelet

  - Fools' Mawt
  - Fools' Mawt (Halloween)
  - Fools' Wignow

- **Rewards:** 50 Shrine Stones

### Forest Creatures - LF

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Unlocked By:** LF MQ 3/The Nitana
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Fight 1 of each monster in Luciola Forest: Puna, Xin, Reenu, Wignow, Awa, Pester, Nitana, Aracni, Aracnu, Rudakai, Mawt, Grey's Mawt
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Luciola Shoes
- **Recommendation:** Depends on how much you like wardrobe and battle samplers! Me, I quite like them.

- **Type:** Streak, Collection
- **Requirements:** Maintain a 3-day streak AFTER picking up the quest, deliver 15 Rope

### Full of Surprises! - Ruins

- **Location:** Underground Ruins
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: DigS Question to Axe
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Ripos
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest & 1 Stone Key
- **Recommendations:** I'm just not into turning down those Stone Chests and Stone Keys. And Ripos *are* a source of valuable Spider Poison and Desert Stones, even if not the best source.

### Fuzzy Cave Pillows - CAVE

- **Location:** Cave
- **Unlocked by:** CAVE MQ2/Talk with Shadow
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Attwo
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Attwo Necklace https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1258-claws-necklace-8904-31953.png
- **Recommendations:** This gets a boilerplate "sure, if you like! Maybe keep an eye out for overlaps?"

### Gansu Watering Hole Puffs - Gansu

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Quest Path:** (open via 3PC MQ5/A Way South) • Gansu: Watering Hole Puna • **Gansu Watering Hole Puffs** 
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Furoxi
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest
- **Recommendations:** DOOO IIIIIITTTT. Such great rewards for so little (relative) work!

### The Gate Path (4/4) - DFO

- **Location:** Dark Forest Outpost
- **Quest Path:** (open via DFO MQ12/Well of Lost Souls) • DFO Reinforced Ardi Lamp Station (1/4) • DFO Light Up the Outpost (2/4) • DFO The Path South (3/4) • **The Gate Path (4/4)** 
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 50 Reinforced Ardi Lamps
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Ardi Lamp https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;hands&#95;ardi&#95;lamp&#95;yellow.png
- **Recommendations:** Yes, this is the end of the quest chain.

### Gather Lucky Stars - ShrineCO

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Colorful Ooze Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Sothai
- **Rewards:** 15 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** I have a weakness for Sothai purely because the original event had a pretty wardrobe reward attached to Sothai battles. But objectively, this is... another quest! Decide what you want to do with it!

### Golden Tooth Monsters - SurfaceC

- **Location:** Raina Surface Camp
- **Unlocked by:** Raina Expedition Trail: Raina Surface Camp (Riza quest)
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 15 Jaihri
- **Rewards:** 3 Harpoons
- **Recommendations:** You'll have to go back to Riza to fight Jaihri, but... go ahead and go for it! Those Harpoons are always nice to have on hand, and Jaihri get you lots of valuable Hardwood (which at this point, you may be wanting to think about selling for Coins).

### Gone Fishing - Balance

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Quest Path:** (open via Riza MQ6/Journey Upriver) • **Gone Fishing** • Balance Gone Fishing Part 2 • Balance Gone Fishing Part 3
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 25 Puna
- **Rewards:** 100 Coins
- **Recommendations:** This quest isn't worth a ton on its own (the Wooden Fishing Rods to fight Puna are pretty expensive, definitely more than 100 Coins). Definitely mix it with other Puna quests if possible, such as Balance's Main Quest 2 or the quests from prior regions. The Gone Fishing quest sequence has three long quests for a cumulative 375 Puna (con) and an absolutely gorgeous River Stone Necklace wardrobe item at the end (plus). Up to you.

### Gone Fishing Part 2 - Balance

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Quest Path:** (open via Riza MQ6/Journey Upriver) • Balance Gone Fishing • **Gone Fishing Part 2** • Balance Gone Fishing Part 3
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 100 Puna
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest + 1 Wooden Key, Wardrobe: Puna Earrings
- **Recommendations:** Again, not worth much on its own. But if you're here, you've already defeated 25 Puna. What's 100 more? And there's funky Puna Earrings in it for you. https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;puna&#95;earrings.png And there's that lovely River Stone Necklace in the future.

### Gone Fishing Part 3 - Balance

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Quest Path:** (open via Riza MQ6/Journey Upriver) • Balance Gone Fishing • Balance Gone Fishing Part 2 • **Gone Fishing Part 3** 
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 250 Puna
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: River Stone Necklace
- **Recommendations:** After you're done with this, you may never have to touch another Puna again. Isn't that a lovely thought? And you'll have the Necklace. Look! https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;featured&#95;crab&#95;necklace.png Isn't it gorgeous?

### Gordi & Griffe Gather - Ruins

- **Location:** Underground Ruins
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: DigS Question to Axe
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 25 Gordi & 5 Griffe
- **Rewards:** 5 Stone Blocks, 5 Sandstone Blocks, 3 Raw Gold
- **Recommendations:** I have a sneaking suspicion those rewards will look a lot more generous when we have houses. Meanwhile, it's up to you if it's worth it!

###Great Library Cleanup!  - HuntS1.2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Illi and 6 Kuay
- **Rewards:** 15 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  These are great sources of Rope and Wood, so you'll get something out of this quest other than the prize (Illi has a few quests you'll overlap with, also), but maybe wait till one or both are dropping Hunter Tokens to make this truly profitable.

### Green Be Gone! - ShrineCO

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Colorful Ooze Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each:
  - Afeppti
  - Crilum
  - Eguley
  - Elobre
  - Fraite
  - Kenkom
  - Lekhop
  - Otpar
  - Roaki
  - Sothai
  - Spodo
  - Zainga
- **Rewards:** 50 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** Obviously you pick this up immediately so that you can double up any other quests. It's not quite as intimidating as it looks: there might be a dozen monsters, but they're mostly quite tiny.

### Green Ooze Invasion - ShrineGO

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Green Ooze Shrine Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each:
  - Mini Ooze
  - Tryi Ooze
  - Wowtri Ooze
  - Balli Ooze
  - Froji Ooze
  - Whaly Ooze
  - Yawni Ooze
  - Wavi Ooze
  - Giant Ooze
  - Giant Ooze House
- **Rewards:** 50 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** Look at all these entries for your bestiary! Look at all the Shrine Stones! You've got this!

### Growing Improvement - HuntS3

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Quest Path:** (open via Hunt Trail: HuntS2 Stumbling Upon Sheep) • **Growing Improvement** • HuntS3 Growing Your Perception 2/3 • HuntS3 Growing Your Tenacity 3/3 • HuntS3 Growing Your Valor 4/4
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Jaihri
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Check out the list of quests Jaihri have to their name - there's quite a few! This will dovetail with a lot of quests in the regular game.

### Growing Your Perception 2/3 - HuntS3

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Quest Path:** (open via Hunt Trail: HuntS2 Stumbling Upon Sheep) • HuntS3 Growing Improvement • **Growing Your Perception 2/3** • HuntS3 Growing Your Tenacity 3/3 • HuntS3 Growing Your Valor 4/4
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Castu, 3 Isartu, and 1 Water Rudakai
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** A lot here rides on how much you like the monsters, and how much you like the rewards. You'll probably want to see whether, as in previous Seasons, this questline culminates in a fifth quest with a nifty wardrobe reward. (I'm writing this just as this quest released and the chain is only three quests long; hopefully I remember to update when the answer drops next month.) In the meantime, you may want to keep up just to save time later, or you may want to take your time.

### Growing Your Tenacity 3/3 - HuntS3

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Quest Path:** (open via Hunt Trail: HuntS2 Stumbling Upon Sheep) • HuntS3 Growing Improvement • HuntS3 Growing Your Perception 2/3 • **Growing Your Tenacity 3/3** • HuntS3 Growing Your Valor 4/4
- **Type:** Battle 
- **Requirements:** Defeat 2 Xyplos
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Same as the previous quest: depends whether it appeals and whether you like the prospect of the end of the questline.

### Growing Your Valor 4/4 - HuntS3

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Quest Path:** (open via Hunt Trail: HuntS2 Stumbling Upon Sheep) • HuntS3 Growing Improvement • HuntS3 Growing Your Perception 2/3 • HuntS3 Growing Your Tenacity 3/3 • **Growing Your Valor 4/4** 
- **Type:** Battle 
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Wyvern
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Fur Ankle Boots https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;Boots&#95;Ankle&#95;Fur&#95;Black.png
- **Recommendations:** I'm personally quite fond of Wyverns, so for me this is a no-brainer. Given that it's unlocked. I don't think I'd rush through the "Growing" line for this.

### Growth & Restoration - SacredS

- **Location:** Raina Sacred Site
- **Unlocked by:** Raina Expedition Trail: SwampL Twisted Treacherous Trails (2/2)
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Ognimaf and deliver 50 Swamp Moss
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest and Wardrobe: Small Gold Crown https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;733-raina-gold-crown-small-4796-18014.png
- **Recommendations:** It's small, it's cheap, it gets you a River Chest. Go for it!

### Growth in Friendship - HuntS3

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS2 Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each: Rea & Pira, Yala, Knusha, Vota, Vaktra, Droxa, Begala
- **Rewards:** 50 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** This pairs really well with at least one Surface Camp quest, so keep an eye out for that. Just.... don't fight any of these monsters in Riza, because you'll be paying more Resources than you would fighting them in Raina.

### Growth Pains - HuntS3

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS2 Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat:
  - 3 Osaril
  - 2 Trainees
  - 1 Furoxi
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** This can dovetail with a few Riza Rivertown quests, but otherwise, no hurries. Take at your own pace.

### Guard Your Feet - 3PC

NOTE: This quest isn't possible to complete until you reach Riza Rivertown. 

- **Location:** Three Points Crossing
- **Quest Path:** (open via 3PC Main Quest 5/A Way South) • 3PC Lighten the Load • **Guard Your Feet** 
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Get 10 Steel Boots and 10 Steel Axes
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest
- **Recommendations:** Did you have a lot of fun with Lighten the Load? Totally your cup of tea? Great! You get to do a lot of the same thing again. Because to make 10 Steel Boots (and at least 9 of them *will* need to be crafted, probably all 10), you'll need the same 30 vials of Leafsung Ink you needed last time (you're getting so good at this!) because you need 10 Fabric Boots to create 10 Steel Boots, and you need 30 Leafsung Boots to create 10 Fabric Boots. You might be able to knock it down to 24 Leafsung Ink if you throw in the Fabric Boots from the Tailor quest and the one Steel Boots you can win from a quest later, but then you'll have no Fabric Boots and no Steel Boots of your own after a lot of grinding. AND YET this isn't as bad as the game gets. If you're running out of quests and getting bored, go ahead and why not.

###Guardian of the Shrine 3/3 - Shrine0

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Quest Path:** (open via Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On) • Shrine0 Keeper of the Shrine 1/3 • Shrine0 Helper of the Shrine 2/3 • **Guardian of the Shrine 3/3**
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Motes, deliver 25 Desert Stones and 25 River Stones
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Motes Stone Belt https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1501-merchant-stone-belt-10181-25983.png
- **Recommendations:**  This is up to you. People with long memories of when the Shrine was first introduced might wonder whether this belt has any special properties - poking around, I've found none (though I've only done a cursory check).  Do remember that River Stones are both easier to get and more in demand to spend late in the Water Region, especially the Raina Expedition, so possibly avoid doing this quest until you've evaluated how that part of the game affects your choices here.

### Guarding the Path - HuntS2

- **Location:** Elder Library 
- **Quest Path:** (open via Hunt Trail: HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library) • **Guarding the Path** • HuntS2 State of Rest • HuntS2 A Distant Figure
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Czanus
- **Rewards:** Hunt Map Piece 4, 5 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** This is (per history) going to end up being basically required to progress in the Hunt. Go ahead for it!

# Side Quests, in Alphabetical Order: H-M

LAST UPDATED 5 MAR 2021

### A Happy Prickle - IC

NOTE: This exact quest was offered during the Alien Meteoroid Expedition in July 2020; if you completed it then, it will not be available now.

- **Location:** Impact Crater
- **Unlocked by:** Alien Meteoroid Trail: 3PC A Way North: Up The Mountain
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 20 Maesc
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Crystal Eyebrows https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;898-crystal-eyebrows-6270-64179.png 
- **Recommendations:** Up to you! Not something I'd necessarily prioritize, but it's a nice little quest.

### Hard Day's Walk - BC

- **Location:** Base Camp
- **Forest Expedition Trail Route:** (open via MT MQ4 / Aid To An Elder) • MT New Adventurous Horizons •  **Hard Day's Walk** • FB Feeding the Lighthouse • IN ANY ORDER [FB Javelin Toss West • FB North: Homeward Bound • FB Stone's Throw East]
- **Type:** Battle, Streak
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Kaija, 1 Xuso, and 1 Sacer; have minimum 3-day Streak when you turn in
- **Rewards:** Unlock Forward Base area
- **Recommendations:** Did you not see? Unlock Forward Base. DO IT!

###Helper of the Shrine 2/3 - Shrine0

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Quest Path:** (open via Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On) • Shrine0 Keeper of the Shrine 1/3 • **Helper of the Shrine 2/3** • Shrine0 Guardian of the Shrine 3/3
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 2 Motes, deliver 15 Desert Stones
- **Rewards:** 2 Shrine Tickets
- **Recommendations:** The last quest had the easiest Shrine Ticket left; this has the easiest two left after that. Fully worth it, in my book. (Even if Desert Stones are pretty in demand in Desert things, at least this is only 15.)

### Helping A Mother - ShrineDucks

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Ducks Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Natida
- **Rewards:** 25 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** None needed

### Helping Those In Need Grow - HuntS3

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS2 Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver:
  - 10 Rusty Amulets
  - 5 Rusty Pendants
  - 1 Gold Bar
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Unless you have 10 Rusty Amulets just lying around, I wouldn't hurry on this. (Ditto on Rusty Pendants and Gold, but you're more likely to actually have them lying around.) The Hunter Tokens just aren't worth as much in and of themselves. Still, fun little thing to do!

### Herding the Herders - HuntS2

- **Location:** Elder Library 
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS2 No Wrong Path
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each: Lubu, Czanus, Pipit
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** This isn't actually in the main line itself, but it unlocks at the same time as the last main line quest. 

### Hounding the Dead (2/4) - DFO

- **Location:** Dark Forest Outpost
- **Quest Path:** (open via DFO MQ12/Well of Lost Souls) • DFO Step Into The Deadlands (1/4) • **Hounding the Dead (2/4)** • DFO Message in a Spirit (3/4) • DFO Flutters Shy & High (4/4)
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Molox
- **Rewards:** 3 Bone Keys and 1 Bone Chest
- **Recommendations:** Molox are pretty simple, apart from the price tag (did you finish Bone To Pick? if not, you might consider taking it up, because those Burhar drop the Steel Chains you'll need)

### Huge, Gigantic, Enormous - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** LF MQ4
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 25 Lombri, 25 Rudakai, 25 Vezi, 25 Wetu, and 25 Tambo (all 1100-2000 word monsters)
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Expedition Tambo Belt
- **Recommendations:** This is a long-term quest that can't be completed until you get halfway through the main quest sequence in the Floating City of Balance, which is a long ways away. These monsters are all over Oge-Mai, not just the Forest Region. If you want to pick up the quest now so that any battles you have against the appropriate creatures count, go ahead; however, this may be worth saving until you run out of other things to do in the entire game, especially since the only reward is essentially bragging rights and a wardrobe item.

### The Hunt Begins

- **Location:** Elder Library 
- **Hunt Trail Route:** (unlocked via LF MQ4/Don't Regift Curses) • MT The Winding Path to Elder Library • HuntS1 Joining the Hunt • **The Hunt Begins** • HuntS1 Deeper Forest Hunting • HuntS1 A Past Not Forgotten • HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library • HuntS2 All Who Wander • HuntS2 Oh, Endless Possibilities! • HuntS2 No Wrong Path • Hunt S2 Stumbling Upon Sheep • HuntS3 To Grow & Change • HuntS3 Bettering Ourselves • HuntS3 Bigger & Brighter • HuntS3 A Bubble Dream • HuntS4 Dirt to Dust • HuntS4 Celebrate Joy • HuntS4 Still Missing Something • HuntS4 Proving Your Friendship
- **Type:** Collection, Streak, Words, Level
- **Requirements:**
  - Collect: 1 Hunt Map Piece
  - Streak: 5-day Streak
  - Words: 5000 words
  - Level: Minimum Level 3
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Scarred Eye [https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;featured&#95;hunt&#95;scar&#95;eye&#95;left&#95;blue.png](https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;featured&#95;hunt&#95;scar&#95;eye&#95;left&#95;blue.png)
- **Recommendations:** It will take a little while to finish this, and you'll need to complete A Clue To The Past before it's possible to complete this (as it stands when this is being written), but it's worth picking up early so the harder parts have time to accumulate. Note that the Time of Reflection quest also requires a streak, so it doubles well with this.

### I Am the Night - CAVE

- **Location:** Cave
- **Unlocked by:** CAVE MQ1/Meet the Shadow
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 20 Tacin
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Tacin Shoulder Pads https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1225-bat-wing-shoulder-pads-8613-82800.png
- **Recommendations:** There's another Tacin-oriented quest later, so if you're Really Concerned about having to fight more 150-word monsters, you can delay this. I wouldn't let that delay me, though.

### Ideas Brought to Life - HuntS4

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail HuntS3 A Bubble Dream
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Weekiwa
- **Rewards:** Hunt Map Piece 11, 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** You know the drill. Weekiwa is clearly a water entity, so my subtle hint dovetails with the quest description to point you to look in water communities.

### Infected Raina Part 1 - SurfaceC

- **Location:** Raina Surface Camp
- **Quest Path:** (open via Raina Expedition Trail: Raina Surface Camp (Riza quest)) • **Infected Raina Part 1** • SurfaceC Infected Raina Part 2 • SurfaceC Infected Raina Part 3 • SurfaceC 4 The Infected
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Vota, 5 Knusha, & Pay 10 Nets, and 10 Leaves
- **Rewards:** 1 Dust Water, unlock Infected Raina 2
- **Recommendations:** We mentioned that this is the region of convoluted sidequests, yes? Infected Raina 3 has some nice benefits. So for this, go ahead and fight your battles for Vota and Knusha, then go to the Forest to farm Vine Nets and Leaves as needed. Or pursue the Hunt Quests against Velts, the ones that start with "Battle of", to eventually unlock Dust Velts, who drops Nets. (And I'd *strongly recommend* getting a jump on Infected Raina Part 2 before turning this in, for morale. That means 30 MORE Rope, 30 MORE Leaves, and 30 MORE Nets, plus all the Rope and River Grass to fight more Vota and Knusha, which means you'll probably need to farm 40 Vine Nets in Mama Tree, have 40 Leaves, then head over to the Desert and get 40 Steel and 40 Stone and craft your Nets). (And if you want to go all the way through to Part 4, that's up by 45 more for each of the above.) If you do the battles last, you might be able to pick up the next quest immediately and enjoy the benefits of overlap.

### Infected Raina Part 2 - SurfaceC

- **Location:** Raina Surface Camp
- **Quest Path:** (open via Raina Expedition Trail: Raina Surface Camp (Riza quest)) • SurfaceC Infected Raina Part 1 • **Infected Raina Part 2** • SurfaceC Infected Raina Part 3 • SurfaceC 4 The Infected
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Pay 30 Net and 30 Leaves, and defeat 10 Vota, 10 Knusha, 10 Yala
- **Rewards:** 2 Dust Water, 1 River Chest, unlock Infected Raina 3
- **Recommendations:** Again, I'd do the battles first and then roam to the Forest and Desert to collect the rest. The resource calculators are almost required at this point.

### Infected Raina Part 3 - SurfaceC

- **Location:** Raina Surface Camp
- **Quest Path:** (open via Raina Expedition Trail: Raina Surface Camp (Riza quest)) • SurfaceC Infected Raina Part 1 • SurfaceC Infected Raina Part 2 • **Infected Raina Part 3** • SurfaceC 4 The Infected
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Wyverns
- **Rewards:** 3 Dust Water, Wardrobe: Raina Mask https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wm&#95;featured&#95;raina&#95;mask.png , ability to craft Raina Sword and Raina Bracelet
- **Recommendations:** Almost there! You got FORTY NETS, this is a piece of cake in comparison! (Start collecting River Stones; you'll need 1000 of them to get both your shiny new beauties in the store.)

### Inking By Number (2/5) - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via MT MQ 4/ Aid To An Elder) • MT Tinkering With Leafsung (1/5) • **Inking By Number (2/5)** • MT Inking of Dust (3/5) • MT Thinking of Ink (4/5) • MT Invisible Ink (5/5)
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 15 Reenu Wings, 15 Feathers, 3 Tambo Mane, 10 Claws, and 50 Dust
- **Rewards:** 3 Wooden Keys, unlock Inking of Dust (3/5) (this is the last part of this 5-quest series which can be completed before unlocking the Water Region)
- **Recommendations:** If you're here, you've already finished Tinkering With Leafsung; might as well do the next step! Also gives you something to do.

### Inking of Dust (3/5) - MT

Note: NOT POSSIBLE to complete till Riza Rivertown is unlocked

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via MT MQ 4/ Aid To An Elder) • MT Tinkering With Leafsung (1/5) • MT Inking By Number (2/5) • **Inking of Dust (3/5)** • MT Thinking of Ink (4/5) • MT Invisible Ink (5/5)
- **Type:** Battle, Streak
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Patliadu, 15 Puna, 5 Wetu, and 1 Arenica, and have a minimum 15-day Streak at the time of turning in
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest, unlock Thinking Like Ink (4/5)
- **Recommendations:** This isn't possible to complete till you've made it to Riza Rivertown in the Water Region (one reason I'm not including it in Forest Resources), and again, this is a long-term quest sequence. I would recommend leaving it alone at least until you get to the Floating City of Balance, at which point it *might* be worth combining with other quests to save effort.

### Insight Grows - HuntS3

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS2 Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 20 Puna
- **Rewards:** 15 Hunter Tokens & Hunt Map Piece 9
- **Recommendations:** The trend continues! Once again, the quest to get Hunt Map Piece 9 does not depend on the quest to get Hunt Map Piece 8. (One of my test accounts is in the interesting position of possessing Hunt Map Piece 9 and not 8.) Still, you'll need this to keep the main Hunt line going, so I suppose it's worth the Puna. (There are approximately 423,293,478 Puna quests in the game, and after completing all of them, I'm rather tired of the fishies. For those who have not completed them, I recommend checking out what quests overlap, especially in Balance.)

###Into Forest Depths 1/3  - HuntS1.2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Quest Path:** (open via Hunt Trail HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library) • **Into Forest Depths 1/3** • HuntS1.2 Into Forest Depths 2/3 • HuntS1.2 Into Forest Depths 3/3 
- **Type:** Collection, Battle
- **Requirements:** Deliver 2 Saliva Vials and 2 Dandeleon Flowers, and defeat 3 Kaija, 3 Xuso, 5 Ardia, 5 Ardii, and 5 Ardis
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  You won't need to focus on Saliva Vials, since they'll pop up anyway while you're battling Kaija; if you've lost track, these monsters can be found entirely within Base Camp and Forward Base (or you can skip FB and battle Ardi-beasts in Mama Tree, if you've done the FB quest unlocking them!) Note that this dovetails well with the quest Base Camp Clearing Duty, if you haven't finished it yet.

###Into Forest Depths 2/3  - HuntS1.2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Quest Path:** (open via Hunt Trail HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library) • HuntS1.2 Into Forest Depths 1/3 • **Into Forest Depths 2/3** • HuntS1.2 Into Forest Depths 3/3 
- **Type:** Collection, Battle
- **Requirements:** Deliver 5 Dinti and 1 Spider Poison; defeat 5 Reudod, 3 Oncaiii, and 1 Finoir
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Facemask https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1534-hunt-neck-guard-10523-15955.png
- **Recommendations:**  Here, we move from BC and FB to Stone City and Tall Trees. The Spider Poison will pop up when you fight Oncaiii anyway; you will get some Dinti from Finoir, but might want to fight its tiny Scofin cousins to rack up more. (Or you might have plenty from the Alien Expedition.)

###Into Forest Depths 3/3  - HuntS1.2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Quest Path:** (open via Hunt Trail HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library) • HuntS1.2 Into Forest Depths 1/3 • HuntS1.2 Into Forest Depths 2/3 • **Into Forest Depths 3/3**
- **Type:** Collection, Battle
- **Requirements:** Deliver 2 Gobkey Trinkets, 2 Dandeleon Flowers, and 2 Essence; defeat 5 Gobkey, 5 Dandeleon, and 5 Maikile
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens and House Item: Hunt Shield Ornament https://4thewords.com/public/hideouts/hideout&#95;element&#95;322&#95;30102/variant&#95;icon&#95;1197&#95;737.png 
- **Recommendations:**  Hey, first House Item reward!!! (It can also be crafted in the Hunter Token Store if you want a more detailed look at it.) You'll definitely get all your resources during your battles, which are largely in Guardian's Lair. (I wonder if the Forward-Base-dwelling Dandeleon was originally a Guardian's-Lair-dwelling Night Dandeleon? If so, the switch was kind to users; Night Dandeleons disappear during the day, but their cousins are available 24/7.)

### Into the Woods - HuntS4

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail HuntS3 A Bubble Dream
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Molox, 4 Osalyu, 10 Spirit Ardia, 1 Lycosta, 1 Chaensi
- **Rewards:** 50 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** A very challenging quest, which I completed for completionism's sake alone. This dovetails with multiple Dark Forest Outpost quests, but otherwise, there's no rush to grab it.

### The Invisible Ink (5/5) - MT

Note: NOT POSSIBLE to complete till partway through the Floating City of Balance

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via MT MQ 4/ Aid To An Elder) • MT Tinkering With Leafsung (1/5) • MT Inking By Number (2/5) • MT Inking of Dust (3/5) • MT Thinking of Ink (4/5) • **The Invisible Ink (5/5)** 
- **Type:** Collection, Battle, Streak
- **Requirements:** Collect 5 Leafsung Ink and 20 Red Dye, defeat 1 Tambo and 3 Bruja, and have a minimum 30-day Streak when you turn it in
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Leafsung Tattoos (and yes, they're multicolor, but here's the baseline: [https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;leafsung&#95;tattoo&#95;yellow.png](https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;leafsung&#95;tattoo&#95;yellow.png) )
- **Recommendations:** DOOO IIIITTTT. I might have mixed feelings about recommending the whole quest sequence to non-obsessive non-high-output people, but if you're here, you're SO CLOSE to rad tattoos. DOOO IIIITTT.

### Iron On Sand - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** 3PC MQ2/Just Another Brick
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 25 Steel Bars
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest, 1 Wooden Key, and 1 vial Leafsung Ink
- **Recommendations:** It's nice to get a matched Chest/Key set, and Leafsung Ink is always amazing, but bear in mind that the game requires literally hundreds of Steel Bars eventually. And 3PC is probably the easiest place to get them, so it won't get easier to grind them. So it depends on whether your reaction to that is "eh, what's another 25?" or "NOT A SINGLE ONE MORE THAN NECESSARY". 

### It's Bigger Inside - LF

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Unlocked by:** 3PC MQ2/Just Another Brick
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 5 Stone Blocks, 5 Sandstone Blocks, 5 Steel Bars, and 5 Glass Bars
- **Rewards:** 3 Wooden Keys
- **Recommendations:** Consider coming back to this one later. You may well find that in the process of grinding other quests, you get a lot of the raw materials for this almost accidentally. Though if you have a lot of Wooden Chests you can't open, this might be worth prioritizing.

### It's Electric! - Balance

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Unlocked by:** Balance MQ1/ Help From A Master
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 10 Nuig String and 25 Algae
- **Rewards:** 3 River Keys
- **Recommendations:** Grab this as soon as it will be filled instantly. (If you're doing the Nuig sidequests, this will be pretty quickly. Or if you're doing any Castu sidequests.) 3 easy River Keys. OTOH Nuig String is a bit of a pain to grind deliberately, so probably don't do this if you're giving the Nuig and Castu sidequests a miss for now.

### Itsy, Bitsy, Teeny - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** LF MQ4
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 25 Reenu, 25 Ardii, 25 Dandeleon, 25 Frizi, and 25 Puna (all 60-220 word monsters)
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Expedition Ardi Belt
- **Recommendations:** This is a long-term quest that can't be completed yet; some of these monsters are rather deep in the Expedition section that you can't unlock till after you finish Mama Tree, and one isn't available till you get to Three Points Crossing (though once you finish Mama Tree these should be pretty available). If you want to pick up the quest now so that any battles you have against the appropriate creatures count, go ahead; just bear in mind you'll be carrying it a while and it might get tricky to keep track of.

### Javelin Toss West - FB

- **Location:** Forward Base
- **Forest Expedition Trail Route:** (open via MT MQ4 / Aid To An Elder) • MT New Adventurous Horizons •  BC Hard Day's Walk • FB Feeding the Lighthouse • IN ANY ORDER [**Javelin Toss West** • FB North: Homeward Bound • FB Stone's Throw East]
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 10 Ardi Lamps
- **Rewards:** Unlock Tall Trees area
- **Recommendations:** If you're trying to beat Tinkering with Leafsung, right beyond this quest is where you get Buhini. But you'll want to have some Nezthai Claws and streak days under your belt before you can get much further than opening this up.

### Joining the Hunt - HuntS1

- **Location:** Elder Library 
- **Hunt Trail Route:** (unlocked via LF MQ4/Don't Regift Curses) • MT The Winding Path to Elder Library • **Joining the Hunt** • HuntS1 The Hunt Begins • HuntS1 Deeper Forest Hunting • HuntS1 A Past Not Forgotten • HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library • HuntS2 All Who Wander • HuntS2 Oh, Endless Possibilities! • HuntS2 No Wrong Path • Hunt S2 Stumbling Upon Sheep • HuntS3 To Grow & Change • HuntS3 Bettering Ourselves • HuntS3 Bigger & Brighter • HuntS3 A Bubble Dream • HuntS4 Dirt to Dust • HuntS4 Celebrate Joy • HuntS4 Still Missing Something • HuntS4 Proving Your Friendship
- **Type:** Wordcount/Level
- **Requirements:** Min Level 3, 3000 Words
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens, unlock the Hunt
- **Recommendations:** This is not optional if you want to participate in the Hunt. Might as well get it done immediately! See what other quests you can do while you're generating 3000 words.

### Jubilant and Strong - HuntS4

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail HuntS3 A Bubble Dream
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 100 of any monster
- **Rewards:** 50 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Look! 50 Hunter Tokens for taking up a quest spot while you're doing other things! Not a bad deal... also easy to pick up later, if you'd rather. :)

### Just a Mean Green - BC

- **Location:** Base Camp
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: MT New Adventurous Horizons
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 25 Xuso
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Xuso Necklace [https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;974-xuso-necklace-7085-57599.png](https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;974-xuso-necklace-7085-57599.png)
- **Recommendations:** There seems to be a new theme of a necklace in each Expedition area, and I heartily approve. Xuso drop a lot of good basics, too.

### Keep In Quarantine - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** MT MQ4 / Aid To An Elder
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Villagers
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendation:** The reward itself isn't worth the effort, but the Leaf Boot and Coin stockpile you'll get from fighting Villagers just might be worth it.

###Keeper of the Shrine 1/3 - Shrine0

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Quest Path:** (open via Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On) • **Keeper of the Shrine 1/3** • Shrine0 Helper of the Shrine 2/3 • Shrine0 Guardian of the Shrine 3/3
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Motes
- **Rewards:** 1 Shrine Ticket
- **Recommendations:**  This is the easiest Shrine Ticket left in the game by the time you get here. Are you telling me you don't want Shrine Tickets?

### Khaki Twisting Beige - DigS

- **Location:** Dig Site
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Gansu Digging Into Desert Sands
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Sakish & 3 Okkorhi
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest & 1 Stone Key
- **Recommendations:** It's nice to have a use for Sakish and Okkorhi, and it's nice to have a source for Stone Chests and Keys. Nice all around.

### Knocking Down Rebels - Hideout

NOTE: This exact quest was offered during the Raina Festival in April 2020; if you completed it then, it will not be available now.

- **Location:** Rebel Raina Hideout
- **Unlocked by:** Raina Expedition Trail: SacredS A Worthy Offering
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each: Cafodu, Wisthu, Grongu, Drau
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Wisthu's Flask https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;708-magic-ingridient-4628-49777.png (7 colors - black, white, blue, purple, yellow, red, green)
- **Recommendations:** This is identical to the Pushing Back Rebels 1/3, so pick them up at the same time and get double results!

### Lead the Way/First Steps - LF

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Unlocked by:** available at game open
- **Type:** Wordcount
- **Requirements:** Write 5000 words. (Note: Attack stat will not affect this number; it's 5K regardless.)
- **Rewards:** 50 Coins
- **Recommendation:** Pick this up as soon as possible. There's never a reason to put off a Wordcount quest, since it will automatically fill while you're doing other things.

### Leafsung Vial Creation - MT

NOTE: This quest is almost impossible to complete until you've completed the quest **Make Attacks Sing**, which is the end of a quest chain in Luciola Forest. However, since it's *unlocked* by opening Mama Tree, I'm counting it thus.

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** LF MQ4
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect/Craft 10 Leafsung Ink
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendation:** Don't bother unless you **really** feel like it. This does not, as far as I can tell, open any other quests, the reward isn't worth the price, and there are many, many other things later you might want to use Leafsung Ink for. They are later in the game, however, so if you're sitting on 9 bottles of Leafsung Ink from the LF quests and just desperately want to craft one more… it's your choice.

### Learn to Fight - LF

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Unlocked by:** available at game open
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Fight 10 of any monster.
- **Rewards:** 50 Coins
- **Recommendation:** Pick this up as soon as possible. It's easy to fill while doing other things.

### Learning to Breathe - IC

- **Location:** Impact Crater
- **Alien Expedition Trail:** (open via 3PC MQ5/A Way South) • 3PC A Way North: Up The Mountain • **Learning to Breathe** • IN ANY ORDER: [SpaceS Technology & Dinti • SpaceS Orders to Repair]
- **Type:** Battle, Wordcount
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Rosarin, 3 Nartha; write 5K words
- **Rewards:** Unlock Spaceship area
- **Recommendations:** This is a priority bc it opens the route to the rest of the Meteoroid. Otherwise, straightforward!

### Leatherbacks of the Cave - CAVE

- **Location:** Cave
- **Unlocked by:** CAVE MQ 7/Dam the Guilt
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Kohej
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Spike Necklace https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1270-spike-necklace-8948-74022.png and Wardrobe: Spike Ankle Bracelet https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1267-spike-ankle-bracelet-8930-28893.png
- **Recommendations:** This gets a boilerplate "sure, if you like!"

### Life's an Experiment - RLab

NOTE: This exact quest was offered during the Alien Meteoroid Expedition in July 2020; if you completed it then, it will not be available now.

- **Location:** Research Lab
- **Unlocked by:** Alien Expedition Trail: SpaceS Orders to Repair
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 each:
  - Sulanica
  - Mowow
  - Xomri
  - Sabu
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Toothless Smile https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;969-toothless-smile-7039-23134.png
- **Recommendations:** No hurries, but... why not? This is a fun one. Note that it's UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE until you've completed the Biodome sequence starting with Set Creatures Free! (1/4) and then quests to unlock each of the individual monsters involved (so 8 quests total).

### Light Up The Outpost (2/4) - DFO

- **Location:** Dark Forest Outpost
- **Quest Path:** (open via DFO MQ12/Well of Lost Souls) • DFO Reinforced Ardi Lamp Station (1/4) • **Light Up the Outpost (2/4)** • DFO The Path South (3/4) • DFO The Gate Path (4/4)
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 10 Reinforced Ardi Lamps
- **Rewards:** 15 Pieces of Parchment
- **Recommendations:** Take a peek ahead and think about how many Reinforced Ardi Lamps you want to craft. 5 isn't *too* expensive, but the amount keeps increasing, and the rewards don't look worth the cost at the moment. Unless you really like the wardrobe version of the Ardi Lamp available at the end.

### Lighten the Load - 3PC

- **Location:** Three Points Crossing
- **Quest Path:** (open via 3PC Main Quest 5/A Way South) • **Lighten the Load** • 3PC Guard Your Feet
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Get/Craft 15 Leafsung Wooden Swords and 15 Leafsung Boots
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest
- **Recommendations:** I'd Turn Back If I Were You. This is where Leafsung Ink first starts to show its ugly intensity. Crafting these 30 items involves 30 vials of Leafsung Ink, which in turn involves 150 Spider Poison (or in other words, 150 Aracni battles; possibly 120, if you spread it out and have a couple dozen Wooden Chests/Keys from Daily Quests supplementing), 150 Essence, 90 Claws, and 90 Dust, apart from the Wood Swords and Leaf Boots and Leaves involved. One little Golden Chest won't come near to replacing the resources you spend on it.

### Lighting the Way - FB

- **Location:** Forward Base
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: BC Hard Day's Walk
- **Type:** Collection, Battle
- **Requirements:** Deliver 25 Dust and 10 Wood, defeat 5 Ardia
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Key, opening Ardi-beasts in Mama Tree
- **Recommendations:** Up to you. Pretty straightforward!

### Little Forest Lake - LF

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Unlocked by:** Riza MQ6/Journey Upriver
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 20 River Grass and 10 River Stones
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendations:** As it please you. Just remember that if you do Raina Surface Camp, you may at one point want 1,000 River Stones or more, and you may regret spending any before that sum is accrued. (The weapons you can craft with the River Stones are beautiful.)

### Local Shrine - Gansu

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Quest Path:** (open via Gansu MQ8) • Gansu Rebuild the Watering Hole • Gansu Respark the Flame • **Local Shrine** • Gansu First Stempo • (ability to craft Stempos), MT Study Break Time
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Get 5 Sacred Feather and 5 White Fur
- **Rewards:** 1 Stempo (and after 1 more quest, ability to craft them)
- **Recommendations:** Getting so close! Go for it. You'll probably end up with 6 Sacred Feathers and 6 White Furs if you battle for them; SAVE THE EXTRA...

### The Long Walk - PG

- **Location:** Purple Gate
- **Unlocked by:** DFO MQ12/Well of Lost Souls
- **Type:** Streak
- **Requirements:** Attain 15-day Streak
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Purple Gate Cape https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1242-cape-8753-75204.png
- **Recommendations:** My recommendation for most Purple Gate sidequests is pretty uniform: take the quest if you like the reward, and you can figure out the rest!

### Lovely Flower Crown - FB

- **Location:** Forward Base
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: BC Hard Day's Walk
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 15 Dandeleon Flowers & 10 Saliva Vials
- **Rewards:** 3 Wooden Chests & 3 Wooden Keys
- **Recommendations:** I would leave this one for a while personally - Saliva Vials are much more useful to hoard until you've cleaned out Stone City, and Dandeleon Flowers will tend to build up in the background no matter what you're doing. But odds are that by the time you're doing a second pass of the Forest Expedition, this will be an easy win.

### Loving Rocky Roads - IC

- **Location:** Impact Crater
- **Unlocked by:** Alien Meteoroid Trail: 3PC A Way North: Up The Mountain
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Brachi & 5 Rhan
- **Rewards:** 2 Stempos & Wardrobe: Brachi Hat https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;886-spiky-rock-hat-6156-94723.png
- **Recommendations:** There are a lot of quests here that need no extra recommendations, so here's a boilerplate to say this is one of them. :)

### Luciola Lanterns/Night Light - LF

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Unlocked by:** available at game open
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 10 Spider Legs and 10 Dust
- **Rewards:** 5 Leaf Boots
- **Recommendation:** Go ahead and try to knock this out on the early side. The Leaf Boots have a Luck value that will be useful later, and the extra Boots will be very useful by the time you get to the third Main Quest. Aracni are your best bet for the Spider Legs, and Xin are your best source of Dust.

### Luciola Lorsa Nests - LF

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Unlocked by:** MT MQ1/ To Great Heights
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect/Craft 3 Lorsa Nests
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendation:** As you please. Remember you'll have to craft your Lorsa Nests in Mama Tree.

### Luciola Materials - 3PC

- **Location:** Three Points Crossing
- **Unlocked by:** 3PC MQ5/A Way South
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Get 15 Feathers, 10 Spider Legs, 5 Lorsa Fur
- **Rewards:** 5 Red Dye
- **Recommendations:** If you haven't finished the Tailor quest yet, here's 5 Red Dye for (relatively) cheap! If you have, here's a chance to restock a bit! Go for it! Remember Lorsa in Mama Tree are the only sources of Lorsa Fur worth mentioning, and that they also drop Feathers.

### Luciola Puna - LF

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Unlocked by:** available at game open
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Battle 10 Puna
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendation:** Do as you please! It can be satisfying to find a use for Raw Stone at this time (you'll need it if you're crafting the Wooden Fishing Rods to hunt Puna), and Chests are always nice. But be aware that a later region has a quest that can be fulfilled simultaneously with this one, so if you wait for it for a nice long time, you can double up. (This guide will be more specific when that comes up.)

### Lumberjack's Tools - LF

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Unlocked by:** available at game open
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 5 Wood Hammers, 3 Dust, 5 Fur, 3 Rope
- **Rewards:** 1 Leafsung Sword
- **Recommendation:** This one is very pricey; 5 Wood Hammers don't sound like much until you do the math and realize that that will cost 75 Wood, 15 Rope, and 75 Coins to manufacture.

### Make Attacks Sing - LF

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via LF MQ3/The Nitana) • LF Make Ink Sing • LF Make Words Sing • **Make Attacks Sing** • (ability to craft Leafsung Ink in Mama Tree)
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 30 Essence, 15 Spider Poison, 10 Claws, 10 Dust
- **Rewards:** 5 Leafsung Ink
- **Recommendation:** Got it! After a LOT of resource farming, you have the capacity to make Leafsung Ink. Which is needed to complete several later sidequests in other regions. 

### Make Ink Sing - LF

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via LF MQ3/The Nitana)  • **Make Ink Sing** • LF Make Words Sing • LF Make Attacks Sing • (ability to craft Leafsung Ink in Mama Tree)
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 10 Essence and 10 Spider Poison
- **Rewards:** 1 Leafsung Ink
- **Recommendation:** This actually isn't very useful in and of itself, but it unlocks a very valuable ability eventually, so you might as well get it out of the way early. (Well, very valuable if you're attached to completing sidequests.)

### Make It Work - LF

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Quest Path Route:** available at game open • **Make It Work** • next step LF Style Is Eternal
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 8 Reenu Wings and 5 Feathers
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Key and 25 Coins
- **Recommendation:** Up to you. Do you like fighting Nitana? Are you interested in Keys? Go ahead! (And completing this quest opens the possibility of more Keys from other quests!) Otherwise, there are other possibilities.

### Make Words Sing - LF

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via LF MQ3/The Nitana)  • LF Make Ink Sing • **Make Words Sing** • LF Make Attacks Sing • (ability to craft Leafsung Ink in Mama Tree)
- **Type:** Wordcount & Collection
- **Requirements:** Write 5,000 Words, Collect 20 Essence, 10 Spider Poison, 5 Claws
- **Rewards:** 3 Leafsung Ink
- **Recommendation:** Getting closer! One more quest to unlock the ability to craft Leafsung Ink! And while you're writting 5K words anyway, combine this with another 5K word quest, such as the Daily Short Story quest available in the Global quests.

### Making Mellow Mowow - RLab

- **Location:** Research Lab
- **Quest Path:** (open via Alien Expedition Trail: SpaceS Orders to Repair) • RLab Set Creatures Free! (1/4) • RLab Create a Clearing (2/4) • RLab Build a Biodome (3/4) • RLab Encourage an Ecosystem (4/4) • IN ANY ORDER [**Making Mellow Mowow  (*unlocks Mowow in Wilderness*)**• RLab Sagacious Sincere Sabu (*unlocks Sabu in Wilderness*) • RLab Silkly Sleek Sulanica (*unlocks Sulanica in Wilderness*)• RLab Zappy Zazzy Xombri (*unlocks Xombri in Wilderness*)• RLab Zooty Zanutaki Zings (*unlocks Zanutaki in Wilderness*)]
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 15 Dinti, 15 Leaves, 5 Stone Blocks, and 3 Essence
- **Rewards:** 1 Stempo, unlock Mowow
- **Recommendations:** There are a lot of quests here that need no extra recommendations, so here's a boilerplate to say this is one of them. :)

- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Polygon Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 25 Cubed Frizi

### Message in a Spirit (3/4) - DFO

- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Spirit Lorsini
- **Rewards:** 1 Bones Chest & 1 Bone Key
- **Recommendations:** Gotta go to Mama Tree to find Spirit Lorsini! Here's some of that "seeing the dead" the last Main Quest was talking about. This is a good time to catch up on some of the stuff for the Reinforced Ardi Lamp Station.

### Mighty Teraleo Hunter - IC

- **Location:** Impact Crater
- **Unlocked by:** Alien Meteoroid Trail: 3PC A Way North: Up The Mountain
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 50 Teraleo
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Teraleo Necklace https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1091-beetle-necklace-7906-81552.png
- **Recommendations:** Look, we know it's all about the necklace and whether you like it or not. And we know you want it. Why not?

- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS2 Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Streak
- **Requirements:** Reach 5 Streak days in a row
- **Rewards:** Hunt Map Piece 7, 10 Hunter Tokens

# Side Quests, in Alphabetical Order: N-R

- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Sacer, 1 Kaija, 1 Nezthai, 1 Xuso, 1 Ardia, 1 Sapilo, 1 Sapira, 1 Sapiti, 1 Buholi, 1 Buhini, 1 Buhovi, 1 Ardii, 1 Ardis
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Expedition Hat  [https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;explorers&#95;hat.png](https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;explorers&#95;hat.png)
- **Recommendations:** Absolutely do it. Nothing to lose, pretty pretty quest.

### Nasty, Dust Air - DFO

- **Location:** Dark Forest Outpost
- **Unlocked by:** Balance MQ5/The Water Calls
- **Type:** Battle and Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 20 Belasi; Collect 20 Reenu Wings, and 100 Dust 
- **Rewards:** 1 Bones Chest
- **Recommendations:** Belasi drop Reenu Wings, so you won't need to travel for that if you're low. You can pick this up immediately, but don't stress it till you get to the Main Quest that requires 12 Belasi anyway.

### Navigating North - Ruins

- **Location:** Underground Ruins
- **Desert Expedition Trail:** (open via Gansu MQ8/Dust to Dust) • Gansu Digging Into Desert Sands • DigS Question to Axe • IN ANY ORDER: [ Ruins Searching South • **Navigating North** • Ruins Withdrawing West • Ruins Excavating East ] • Ruins Tunnel Locked On • (access to Shrine of Ages)
- **Type:** Words, Battle
- **Requirements:** Write 750 Words, defeat 1 Yantao
- **Rewards:** 5 Raw Steel, progress toward Shrine of Ages
- **Recommendations:** Do it! Make sure you have the other directional quests at the same time, so you're not duplicating effort on wordcount.

### New Adventurous Horizons - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Forest Expedition Trail Route:** (open via MT MQ4 / Aid To An Elder) • **New Adventurous Horizons** •  BC Hard Day's Walk • FB Feeding the Lighthouse • IN ANY ORDER [FB Javelin Toss West • FB North: Homeward Bound • FB Stone's Throw East]
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Tylu (also be min level 3, but if you're here, you'll be past level 3 anyway)
- **Rewards:** Unlock Base Camp in Expedition
- **Recommendations:** DO IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. Wandering around Expedition is fun, and it's important to know your way around the area if you want to get through the later parts of the main questline. Definitely worth it.

### New Family of Friends - SurfaceC

NOTE: This exact quest was offered during the Raina Festival in April 2020; if you completed it then, it will not be available now.

- **Location:** Raina Surface Camp
- **Unlocked by:** Raina Expedition Trail: Raina Surface Camp (Riza quest)
- **Location:** Raina Surface Camp
- **Type:** Wordcount, Streak
- **Requirements:** Attain 5-day streak, write 5000 words

### New River Barge - Riza

- **Location:** Riza Rivertown
- **Unlocked by:** Riza MQ6/Journey Upriver
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Get 25 Hardwood, 10 Steel, 10 Wood, 8 Rope, 15 River Stone, and 5 Raw Fabric
- **Rewards:** 5 Stone Keys
- **Recommendations:** Five Stone Keys. FIVE STONE KEYS. Weigh that against the costs, but… FIVE STONE KEYS. Totally worth it for me. 

### New Style - LF

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Unlocked by:** available at game open
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 5 Feathers and 10 Fur
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Classic Shorts
- **Recommendation:** Up to you. Wardrobe rewards are only good for dressing up your avatar, but that can be *fun*. Nitana are your best (and in Luciola, only) source of feathers; Awa, Mawt, and Pester are good sources of fur.

### Night Light

see **Luciola Lanterns**

### No Safe Feet - SwampL

- **Location:** Swamplands
- **Unlocked by:** Raina Expedition Trail: SurfaceC Energy Now, Tired Later
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Swamp Wignow
- **Rewards:** 50 Coins & Wardrobe: Bone Shoulder Pads https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;717-bone-shoulder-pads-4704-43502.png
- **Recommendations:** Up to you. I find Swamp Wignow lovely opponents, but the rewards are unspectacular.

### No Wrong Path - HuntS2

- **Location:** Elder Library 
- **Hunt Trail Route:** (unlocked via LF MQ4/Don't Regift Curses) • MT The Winding Path to Elder Library • HuntS1 Joining the Hunt • HuntS1 The Hunt Begins • HuntS1 Deeper Forest Hunting • HuntS1 A Past Not Forgotten • HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library • HuntS2 All Who Wander • HuntS2 Oh, Endless Possibilities! • **No Wrong Path** • Hunt S2 Stumbling Upon Sheep • HuntS3 To Grow & Change • HuntS3 Bettering Ourselves • HuntS3 Bigger & Brighter • HuntS3 A Bubble Dream • HuntS4 Dirt to Dust • HuntS4 Celebrate Joy • HuntS4 Still Missing Something • HuntS4 Proving Your Friendship

- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Facepaint Eye Shadow https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;664-hunt-facepaint-eye-shadow-4007-92291.png
- **Recommendations:** Yet another quest-that's-really-an-extra-reward-for-another-one. A Distant Figure quest will net you this. Go for it.

### Nooks and Crannies - CAVE

- **Location:** Purple Gate
- **Unlocked by:** PG MQ 10/A Familiar Fight
- **Type:** Streak
- **Requirements:** Attain a 15-day Streak
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Wet Hair https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1240-wethair-8725-22131.png
- **Recommendations:** This gets a boilerplate "sure, if you like!"

### North: Homeward Bound - FB

- **Location:** Forward Base
- **Forest Expedition Route:** (open via MT MQ4 / Aid To An Elder) • MT New Adventurous Horizons •  BC Hard Day's Walk • FB Feeding the Lighthouse • IN ANY ORDER [FB Javelin Toss West • **North: Homeward Bound** • FB Stone's Throw East]
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 15 Ardi Lamps
- **Rewards:** Unlock Guardian's Lair area
- **Recommendations:** If you want to find Night Dandeleons and their pretty crowns, make sure you stop by here. Plus, completionists need this.

### Nothing But Trouble - SC

- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: FB Stone's Throw East
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 2 Sapilo, 2 Sapira, and 2 Sapiti, and deliver 6 Vine Nets and 15 Rope
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest & 1 Wooden Key
- **Recommendations:** I mentioned I like Sapi-beasts, right? But at this point in the game, I personally have hundreds of Vine Nets and can spare a few. They might be pricier to you. Bear in mind that the Vine Nets tend to be easiest to get from Mama Tree Wooden Chests.

###NPC's Here to Help - ShrineNPC

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Wardrobe: Special Event NPC Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each: 
  - Untu Captain Uo

- **Recommendations:**  Look, you didn't buy that Bracelet to NOT fight all the monsters here and add them to your Bestiary. You know you didn't. Go ahead and get them! And get a new pair of pants while you're at it!

### Of Vibrant Growth - HuntS3

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS2 Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Wordcount
- **Requirements:** Write 10K Words
- **Rewards:** 15 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** I will always recommend wordcount quests, because they will always fill themselves without you having to think about it. Win/win.

### Oh, Endless Possibilities! - HuntS2

- **Location:** Elder Library 
- **Hunt Trail Route:** (unlocked via LF MQ4/Don't Regift Curses) • MT The Winding Path to Elder Library • HuntS1 Joining the Hunt • HuntS1 The Hunt Begins • HuntS1 Deeper Forest Hunting • HuntS1 A Past Not Forgotten • HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library • HuntS2 All Who Wander • **Oh, Endless Possibilities!** • HuntS2 No Wrong Path • Hunt S2 Stumbling Upon Sheep • HuntS3 To Grow & Change • HuntS3 Bettering Ourselves • HuntS3 Bigger & Brighter • HuntS3 A Bubble Dream • HuntS4 Dirt to Dust • HuntS4 Celebrate Joy • HuntS4 Still Missing Something • HuntS4 Proving Your Friendship
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect Hunt Map Piece 5
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Facepaint Star (seven variations per cheek, 14 total): https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;670-hunt-facepaint-star-4091-65557.png
- **Recommendations:** The requirements for this quest are basically "complete State of Rest quest". It's really a two-for-one thing, in the end.

### On the Wrong Path - HuntS4

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail HuntS3 A Bubble Dream
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Infected Golem
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** This one requires monsters from midway through the Purple Gate, and it's entirely optional for progressing the Hunt. (It also dovetails with at least one PG quest.)

### One Hundred Creatures - BC

- **Location:** Base Camp
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: MT New Adventurous Horizons
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 100 monsters of any kind
- **Rewards:** 5 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** Always good to have running in the background. It'll fill up without you having to pay any attention, and Stempos are nice to have.

### One of Us - LF

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Unlocked by:** available at game open
- **Type:** Forum
- **Requirements:** Create 1 new thread in the Forum
- **Rewards:** 4 Core Crystals
- **Recommendation:** Go for it and complete it immediately! The Introductions section of the Forum is just for you. 4 Core Crystals don't buy much by themselves, but they're nice to have, and it's nice to introduce yourself to the community. (But no, you won't be able to earn enough Core Crystals for more than one month's subscription by playing, and that one month's worth will be a long time coming. It's probably better to spend on wardrobe.)

### One Rocky Start (1/2) - IC

NOTE: This exact quest was offered during the Alien Meteoroid Expedition in July 2020; if you completed it then, it will not be available now.

- **Location:** Impact Crater
- **Quest Path:** (open via Alien Meteoroid Trail: 3PC A Way North: Up The Mountain) • **One Rocky Start (1/2**) • IC Crown of Rocks (2/2)
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each:
  - Kolbs
  - Nartha
  - Oxie
  - Krang
  - Rhan
  - Ipo
  - Erbor
  - Arir
  - Halix
  - Maesc
  - Brachi
  - Galatre
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe x2: Halix Hat https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;883-snail-hat-6150-16248.png and Golden Shield https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;gold&#95;shield&#95;4thewords.png
- **Recommendations:** This involves monsters from three of the Alien Meteoroid Expedition areas, so be prepared to travel a bit.

### Orders to Repair - SpaceS

- **Location:** Spaceship
- **Alien Expedition Trail:** (open via 3PC MQ5/A Way South) • 3PC A Way North: Up The Mountain • IC Learning to Breathe • IN ANY ORDER: [SpaceS Technology & Dinti • **Orders to Repair**]
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Szalin, deliver 5 Steel Bars & 5 Stone Blocks
- **Rewards:** Unlock Research Lab
- **Recommendations:** Research Lab has a ton of fun stuff, I recommend.

### Osaril Nests - Riza

- **Location:** Riza Rivertown
- **Unlocked by:** Gansu MQ8/Dust to Dust
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Osaril
- **Rewards:** 2 Harpoons
- **Recommendations:** Great for helping with the Battle Ready quest, and for hunting Patliadu with Amateur and Apprentice Fisherman; not-so-great use of Vine Nets, which suddenly look a lot more precious if you take up the giant later-game sidequests that require 120 of them. If you have a sane sense of proportion and can pace yourself, though, there's no reason not to do it.

### Our Waymark Stones - HuntS2

- **Location:** Elder Library 
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 10 Raw Stone, 10 Raw Sandstone, and 10 Desert Stones
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** If you haven't completed the regular Desert Region quests, think carefully about this. These resources are fairly easy and quick to collect, but also required in maddening quantities in Oge-Mai Valley. However, they're mostly required in side quests, so as long as you're not giving away the last 10 of these items, you should be good to prioritize as you please.

### Paint Battle - ShrineDucks

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Ducks Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 each: Aita, Tian, Dati
- **Rewards:** 25 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** None needed

### A Past Not Forgotten - HuntS1

- **Location:** Elder Library 
- **Hunt Trail Route:** (unlocked via LF MQ4/Don't Regift Curses) • MT The Winding Path to Elder Library • HuntS1 Joining the Hunt • HuntS1 The Hunt Begins • HuntS1 Deeper Forest Hunting • **A Past Not Forgotten** • HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library • HuntS2 All Who Wander • HuntS2 Oh, Endless Possibilities! • HuntS2 No Wrong Path • Hunt S2 Stumbling Upon Sheep • HuntS3 To Grow & Change • HuntS3 Bettering Ourselves • HuntS3 Bigger & Brighter • HuntS3 A Bubble Dream • HuntS4 Dirt to Dust • HuntS4 Celebrate Joy • HuntS4 Still Missing Something • HuntS4 Proving Your Friendship
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Possess one Hunt Map Piece 3
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Pauldrons [https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;armor&#95;pauldrons.png](https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;armor&#95;pauldrons.png)
- **Recommendations:** I'll tell you a secret: this is not a quest. Not really. The requirements are basically "complete the Elder Library's Security quest and don't sell what you get from it". So go do that, and get some cool wardrobe items as a bonus when you're done.

### The Path South (3/4) - DFO

- **Location:** Dark Forest Outpost
- **Quest Path:** (open via DFO MQ12/Well of Lost Souls) • DFO Reinforced Ardi Lamp Station (1/4) • DFO Light Up the Outpost (2/4) • **The Path South (3/4)** • DFO The Gate Path (4/4)
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 25 Reinforced Ardi Lamps
- **Rewards:** 25 Dust Chains
- **Recommendations:** No, I haven't found a use for Dust Chains yet. The chief use of this quest is unlocking the next.

### Peace and Sunflowers - ShrineCar

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Carnival Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 2 Mahor
- **Rewards:** 30 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** Exactly what it looks like. And Mahor maintains a NaNo pace (one Mahor at zero attack will equal 1/30 of 50K), so it's nice for checking progress on that front.

### Peppy Piñata Party - ShrineBird

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Birds Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Katock
- **Rewards:** 50 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** Punch the piñata, 500 words at a time, and get shinies. What's not to like?

### Pieces For Peace - DFO

- **Location:** Dark Forest Outpost
- **Quest Path:** (open via Balance MQ5/The Water Calls) • DFO A Shaman's Rope • **Pieces for Peace** 
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 35 Rat Tails
- **Rewards:** 1 Bones Chest
- **Recommendations:** Dooo iiiiittt. Just make sure you keep Pit of Nightmares in mind while you're doing it.

### Pit of Nightmares - DFO

- **Location:** Dark Forest Outpost
- **Unlocked by:** Balance MQ5/The Water Calls
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 250 Chu
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Dark Forest Bones Skirt https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;darkforest&#95;skirt.png
- **Recommendations:** Pick up immediately if you have space, complete at leisure. You'll be battling 12 Chu for the Main Quests, so it's up to you how long to wait. Also, Chu are your best source of Rat Tails, so if you want to do any of those quests, this kind of works as a doubling up. (I do adore that skirt. Totally worth 25K words.)

### Poly Wants a Pie - ShrinePoly

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Polygon Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Poly Wignow
- **Rewards:** 25 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** None needed

### Preventing Purple Power-Ups - PG

- **Location:** Purple Gate
- **Unlocked by:**  PG MQ1/Then The Bird Said
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 20 Vibidi and 3 Oncara
- **Rewards:** 1 Bones Chest & 1 Bone Key
- **Recommendations:** My recommendation for most Purple Gate sidequests is pretty uniform: take the quest if you like the reward, and you can figure out the rest!

### Prime Birb Time - ShrineBird

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Birds Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Gayol, 3 Peq, and 1 Ralbone
- **Rewards:** 25 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** The pride of defeating Ralbone should be the queen of this quest, but honestly, I think the Peq are more demanding. Still, 25 Shrine Stones is 25 Shrine Stones!

### Prime Party Piñata - ShrineGiant

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Giants Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Takra
- **Rewards:** 25 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** Easiest quest in this bunch, hands-down. Plus, piñata.

### Problems Feed Solutions - HuntS3

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS2 Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 20 Caricaco
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Check out other Caricaco quests in Balance before completing this. There's a reason the info for this quest references "Tambo Snacks". "River Walkers" is also worth doubling up with this.

### Projecting Light - RLab

NOTE: This exact quest was offered during the Alien Meteoroid Expedition in July 2020; if you completed it then, it will not be available now.

- **Location:** Research Lab
- **Unlocked by:** Alien Expedition Trail: SpaceS Orders to Repair
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 each:
  - Wignow Hologram/V0.44
  - Suulan Hologram/V0.44
  - Sassi Hologram/V0.44
  - Lombri Hologram/V0.44
  - Maesc Hologram/V0.44
  - Lubu Hologram/V0.44
  - Xin Hologram/V0.44
  - Arenica Hologram/V0.44
  - Tambo Hologram/V0.44
  - Nuig Hologram/V0.44
  - Kiru Hologram/V0.44
  - Zanthei Hologram/V0.44
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Monster Hologram Pet https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;993-monster-hologram-pet-7226-90927.png (available in 12 varieties, 1 for each hologram)
- **Recommendations:** PICK THIS UP. SO CUTE.

### Protect the Body - Gansu

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Quest Path:** (open via Gansu MQ8/Dust to Dust) • **Protect the Body** • Gansu Protect the Mind • Gansu Protect the Spirit
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 50 Desert Stones
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest & 1 Stone Key
- **Recommendations:** This is the "easier than Stone Collector" quest I was talking about: 50 Desert Stones for a Stone Chest and Stone Key. Do it! (Unless you really, really hate collecting Desert Stones and need to save what you have.)

### Protect the Mind - Gansu

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Quest Path:** (open via Gansu MQ8/Dust to Dust) • Gansu Protect the Body • **Protect the Mind** • Gansu Protect the Spirit
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 100 Desert Stones
- **Rewards:** 5 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** Having fun collecting Desert Stones yet? If you finish this, you'll unlock another with the same feel! Stempos *are* awfully nice to have, and these are hardly the most expensive in the game. But if you get tired of Desert Stones, there are alternatives.

### Protect the Spirit - Gansu

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Quest Path:** (open via Gansu MQ8/Dust to Dust) • Gansu Protect the Body • Gansu Protect the Mind • **Protect the Spirit** 
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 200 Desert Stones
- **Rewards:** 10 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** This is the point where I began hating Desert Stones, but at least it's the last sidequest to demand them in large numbers. You finished Protect the Mind, if you're here. You know what it takes. Decide if it's worth it!

### Protecting the Past - Hunt S1

- **Location:** Elder Library 
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS1 Joining the Hunt
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 10 Rusty Amulets and 10 Rusty Pendants
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** This is a bit on the expensive side - odds are it'll take far fewer battles to get the reward by fighting Sassi than by any other means. Still, if you happen to have a bunch lying around, it's worth considering.

### Proving Your Cunning 4/4 - HuntS1

- **Location:** Elder Library 
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via Hunt Trail HuntS1 Joining the Hunt) • HuntS1 Proving Your Worth 1/4 • HuntS1 Proving your Curiosity 2/4 • HuntS1 Proving Your Perserverance 3/4 • **Proving Your Cunning 4/4** • HuntS1 Proving Your Mettle 5/6 • HuntS1 Proving Your Strength 6/6
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Sapira, 2 Sapilo, and 3 Sapiti
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Don't forget to battle at least one Kaija in Base Camp for each Sapi-beast you intend to battle (Kaija drop the Saliva Vials required to protect from the Sapi-monsters' poison). Then head over to Stone City in Expedition (got to complete our tour) to beat these beasties. Make sure you keep your Luck up, and you could get a Spider Poison per battle here. Nice rewards.

### Proving Your Curiosity 2/4 - HuntS1

- **Location:** Elder Library 
- **Quest Path Route:**  (open via Hunt Trail HuntS1 Joining the Hunt) • HuntS1 Proving Your Worth 1/4 • **Proving your Curiosity 2/4** • HuntS1 Proving Your Perserverance 3/4 • HuntS1 Proving Your Cunning 4/4 • HuntS1 Proving Your Mettle 5/6 • HuntS1 Proving Your Strength 6/6
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 6 Nitana
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** This combines well with the Mama Tree Sidequest Fair, Standard, Middling (or, if you just like Nitana, don't worry about this and keep going).

###Proving Your Friendship

- **Hunt Trail Route:** (unlocked via LF MQ4/Don't Regift Curses) • MT The Winding Path to Elder Library • HuntS1 Joining the Hunt • HuntS1 The Hunt Begins • HuntS1 Deeper Forest Hunting • HuntS1 A Past Not Forgotten • HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library • HuntS2 All Who Wander • HuntS2 Oh, Endless Possibilities! • HuntS2 No Wrong Path • Hunt S2 Stumbling Upon Sheep • HuntS3 To Grow & Change • HuntS3 Bettering Ourselves • HuntS3 Bigger & Brighter • HuntS3 A Bubble Dream • HuntS4 Dirt to Dust • HuntS4 Celebrate Joy • HuntS4 Still Missing Something • **Proving Your Friendship**
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat the Bard 4 times
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Bard's Pet https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm_1502-ferret-pet-10188-43895.png
- **Recommendations:**  It's the capstone of the first year of the Hunt! Complete and celebrate your completion!

### Proving Your Mettle 5/6 - HuntS1

- **Location:** Elder Library 
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via Hunt Trail HuntS1 Joining the Hunt) • HuntS1 Proving Your Worth 1/4 • HuntS1 Proving your Curiosity 2/4 • HuntS1 Proving Your Perserverance 3/4 • HuntS1 Proving Your Cunning 4/4 • **Proving Your Mettle 5/6** • HuntS1 Proving Your Strength 6/6
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each Lorsa, Illi, Kuay, Tambo
- **Rewards:** 15 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** We've done our Luciola battles and our Forest Expedition battles; now it's time to prove ourselves in Mama Tree. Illi and Tambo are rather popular for sidequests, so maybe see if there are any that interest you before going into this.

### Proving Your Perseverance 3/4 - HuntS1

- **Location:** Elder Library 
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via Hunt Trail HuntS1 Joining the Hunt) • HuntS1 Proving Your Worth 1/4 • HuntS1 Proving your Curiosity 2/4 • **Proving Your Perserverance 3/4** • HuntS1 Proving Your Cunning 4/4 • HuntS1 Proving Your Mettle 5/6 • HuntS1 Proving Your Strength 6/6
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat:
  - 1 Buholi
  - 1 Sacer
  - 3 Kaija
  - 1 Gobkey
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** This might be subtitled "Explore Expedition!" because that's what it is. You'll need to complete Mama Tree before you can pick up the **New Adventurous Horizons** quest to unlock the Forest Expedition, and then you'll need to battle Sacer and Kaija in Base Camp, and then complete Hard Day's Walk to open Forward Base, then fight Nezthai in Forward Base to get the prerequisite 3 Nezthai Claws for Buholi, complete the Feeding the Lighthouse quest in Forward Base to unlock the quests to unlock the other three Forest Expedition areas, beat Javelin Toss West and North: Homeward Bound quests, then fight Buholi in Tall Trees and Gobkey in Guardian's Lair. Whew! That said, it's worth unlocking Expedition (and the followup quest to this requires unlocking Stone City, so don't skip that quest forever). If you were wondering where Buhini are, that's where. And there are other Mama Tree sidequests that benefit from Expedition being opened.

### Proving Your Strength 6/6 - HuntS1

- **Location:** Elder Library 
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via Hunt Trail HuntS1 Joining the Hunt) • HuntS1 Proving Your Worth 1/4 • HuntS1 Proving your Curiosity 2/4 • HuntS1 Proving Your Perserverance 3/4 • HuntS1 Proving Your Cunning 4/4 • HuntS1 Proving Your Mettle 5/6 • **Proving Your Strength 6/6** 
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 6 Tylu
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Small Axe [https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;678-small-axe-4213-56837.png](https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;678-small-axe-4213-56837.png)
- **Recommendations:** There are bunches of sidequests that require fighting Tylu, so go comb the Mama Tree sidequests to be sure there aren't any you want to double up with (especially A Family Tree, with its almost-equal requirements)

### Proving Your Worth 1/4 - HuntS1

- **Location:** Elder Library 
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via Hunt Trail HuntS1 Joining the Hunt) • **Proving Your Worth 1/4** • HuntS1 Proving your Curiosity 2/4 • HuntS1 Proving Your Perserverance 3/4 • HuntS1 Proving Your Cunning 4/4 • HuntS1 Proving Your Mettle 5/6 • HuntS1 Proving Your Strength 6/6
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat:
  - 3 Reenu
  - 2 Wignow
  - 1 Pester
  - 1 Mawt
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** This is mostly good for bragging rights, although it's pretty satisfying to have done. It dovetails well with the Luciola Forest quest Forest Creatures, and you'll get useful inventory battling these monsters.

### Pushing Back Rebels (1/3) - Hideout

- **Location:** Rebel Raina Hideout
- **Quest Path:** (open via Raina Expedition Trail: SacredS A Worthy Offering) • **Pushing Back Rebels 1/3** • Pushing Back Rebels 2/3 (Hideout quest) • Pushing Back Rebels 3/3 (Hideout quest)
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each: Cafodu, Drau, Wisthu, Grongu
- **Rewards:** 5 Reinforced Rope and Wardrobe: Large Gold Crown https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;732-raina-gold-crown-large-4794-33911.png
- **Recommendations:** I like the challenge of this line, but admittedly some might find it less than incredibly useful. It is, however, an excellent excuse to battle several monsters with excellent drops. (And for this one, an excellent crown.) This particular quest doubles with Knocking Down Rebels, as they have the same requirements.

### Pushing Back Rebels (2/3) - Hideout

- **Location:** Rebel Raina Hideout
- **Quest Path:** (open via Raina Expedition Trail: SacredS A Worthy Offering) • Pushing Back Rebels 1/3 (Hideout quest) • **Pushing Back Rebels 2/3** • Pushing Back Rebels 3/3 (Hideout quest)
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 each: Cafodu, Drau, Wisthu, Grongu
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest & 1 River Key
- **Recommendations:** Again, the reward of fighting the monsters is greater than the result, unless you're particularly fond of the final bit of the chain.

### Pushing Back Rebels (3/3) - Hideout

- **Location:** Rebel Raina Hideout
- **Quest Path:** (open via Raina Expedition Trail: SacredS A Worthy Offering) • Pushing Back Rebels 1/3 (Hideout quest) • Pushing Back Rebels 2/3 (Hideout quest) • **Pushing Back Rebels 3/3** 
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 each: Cafodu, Drau, Wisthu, Grongu
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Raina Golden Warrior Mask https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;779-golden-facemask-5298-53682.png
- **Recommendations:** Why are you looking at this? Like you were going to complete the first two parts and not the final one? Ha. Nah, just go ahead and finish it out.

### Quench a Thirst - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** Riza MQ6/Journey Upriver
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 25 Dí Bags
- **Rewards:** 3 Wooden Chests, 1 Wooden Key, and 3 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** Those chests, that key, and those Stempos are mighty nice, but those Dí Bags are mighty expensive. I'd recommend saving this at least until you've done everything you want to do in the Water Region (quests, battles, etc) so that you can take maximum advantage of what River Water you accrue on the way.

### Question to Axe - DigS

- **Location:** Dig Site
- **Desert Expedition Trail:** (open via Gansu MQ8/Dust to Dust) • Gansu Digging Into Desert Sands • **Question to Axe** • IN ANY ORDER: [ Ruins Searching South • Ruins Navigating North • Ruins Withdrawing West • Ruins Excavating East ] • Ruins Tunnel Locked On • (access to Shrine of Ages)
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Craft 3 Pickaxe to deliver
- **Rewards:** Unlock Ruins area
- **Recommendations:** You want to continue on, yes? Here's the key! You can craft Pickaxes in Nabia's Dig Station.

### Raina Surface Camp - Riza

- **Location:** Riza Rivertown
- **Raina Expedition Trail Route:** (open via Main Quest Highway Riza MQ6/Journey Upriver) • **Raina Surface Camp** • SurfaceC Energy Now, Tired Later • SwampL Wading Through & Onwards (1/2) • SwampL Twisted Treacherous Trails (2/2) • SacredS A Worthy Offering
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Yala and 5 Vota
- **Rewards:** Unlock Raina Surface Camp
- **Recommendations:** Do it! This area is a lot of fun, and a lot of water resources are marginally easier to grind in the Raina Expedition.

### Rebuild the Dock - DFO

- **Location:** Dark Forest Outpost
- **Unlocked by:** Balance MQ5/The Water Calls
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 150 Wood, 50 Hardwood, 150 Rope, 50 Reinforced Rope, 25 Steel Bars, and 25 Stone Blocks
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Dark Forest Skirt https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;dark&#95;forest&#95;skirt&#95;blue.png
- **Recommendations:** ... it depends how much you like that skirt. It really is pretty. It's also better as a long-term goal than a short-term one, I think. And since it's a pure Collection quest, you don't need to be holding onto it in your Questbook to be able to work on it.

### Rebuild the Watering Hole - Gansu

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Quest Path:** (open via Gansu MQ8) • **Rebuild the Watering Hole** • Gansu Respark the Flame • Gansu Local Shrine • Gansu First Stempo • (ability to craft Stempos), MT Study Break Time
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Get 50 Raw Fabric, 10 Stone Blocks, and 15 Rope
- **Rewards:** 1 Stempo (and after more quests, ability to craft them)
- **Recommendations:** DO IT. This is the first quest in a path to be able to craft infinite Stempos, and that ability is worth it. (Don't forget that Rulo are a great source of Stone Blocks!)

### Recovering Stolen Goods - MSite

- **Location:** Mining Site
- **Unlocked by:** Alien Expedition Trail: SpaceS Technology & Dinti
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Ityf, deliver 50 Dinti, 10 Raw Steel, and 15 Raw Stone
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Thief Hood https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1095-thief-hood-7922-16062.png
- **Recommendations:** Look, this reward was so appealing to me that I paused scoping out the areas just so I could grab it. So pretty. But I also had the Dinti ready to hand from previous work, so that one thing was all I had to do.

### Reflections for Improvement - CAVE

- **Location:** Cave
- **Unlocked by:** CAVE MQ8/The Final Fight
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Reflections
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Reflection Puddle https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1227-avatar-reflection-puddle-8617-20633.png
- **Recommendations:** Last quest in the Cave. Personally, I have  soft spot for Reflections with their lovely drops and patient timers, though YMMV. And of course there's the Reflection Puddle, which I love.

### Reinforced Ardi Lamp Station (1/4) - DFO

- **Location:** Dark Forest Outpost
- **Quest Path:** (open via DFO MQ12/Well of Lost Souls) • **Reinforced Ardi Lamp Station (1/4)** • DFO Light Up the Outpost (2/4) • DFO The Path South (3/4) • DFO The Gate Path (4/4)
- **Type:** Collection, Battle, Streak
- **Requirements:** 
  - Collect:
    - 50 Wood
    - 15 Rope
    - 5 Steel Bars
    - 50 Ardia Dust
    - 50 Ardii Dust
    - 50 Ardis Dust
  - Maintain 15-day Streak
  - Defeat:
    - 1 Wetu
    - 1 Tylu
    - 1 Xuso
    - 1 Osaril
    - 1 Burhar
- **Rewards:** 1 Bones Chest, 1 Bone Key, 5 Reinforced Ardi Lamps
- **Recommendations:** If you want to do it, pick it up as soon as it's available, and see how you can dovetail it with the Step Into The Deadlands quest chain of battling the dead across Oge-Mai and Expedition. Be warned: if you want to complete this entire quest chain, you'll need more than 50 each of Ardi* Dust. More like 290 each...

### Respark the Flame - Gansu

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Quest Path:** (open via Gansu MQ8) • Gansu Rebuild the Watering Hole • **Respark the Flame** • Gansu Local Shrine • Gansu First Stempo • (ability to craft Stempos), MT Study Break Time
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 5 Stone Blocks, 5 Sandstone Blocks, 10 Hardwood, 20 Desert Stone
- **Rewards:** 1 Stempo (and after more quests, ability to craft them)
- **Recommendations:** Again, do it: ability to craft Stempos is worth it, IMHO. If you're wondering what Hardwood is, you probably haven't run over to Riza yet (and you might need to go fight a few Riza battles to get enough), but that's fine. Go play around in the Riza quests and come on back. 

### River Dams - Riza

- **Location:** Riza Rivertown
- **Unlocked by:** Gansu MQ8/Dust to Dust
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 15 Jaihri
- **Rewards:** 100 Coins
- **Recommendations:** Pick it up immediately; you'll be fighting 8 Jaihri for Main Quests anyway, and might as well get credit for them. (Though if you want to be hyper-efficient and also hyper-completionist, wait to fight the other 7 Jaihri till you open Raina Surface Camp and pick up the Jaihri quest there.)

### River Grass Supply - Riza

- **Location:** Riza Rivertown
- **Unlocked by:** Gansu MQ8/Dust to Dust
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Gather 50 River Grass
- **Rewards:** 1 Steel Boots
- **Recommendations:** This is probably an easy win, and the cheapest way to get Steel Boots in the game. However, if you don't have a ton of River Grass on hand, consider saving it till the end of Riza. There's no penalty for waiting, and you'll have a better sense of supply then.

### River Landwalkers - Balance

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Unlocked by:** Riza MQ6/Journey Upriver
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Isartu and 25 Caricaco
- **Rewards:** 250 Coins
- **Recommendations:** Isartu kindly drop River Stones, which are great if you're trying to buy anything in Raina, and Leather Rolls, which are great for Water Masks and fundraising. Caricaco are pretty darn easy. This does come to almost 15K words, but Attack values can offset that. On the flip side, there are at least two later quests that also require fighting Isartu, and one of them requires 20 of them, so it might be worth it to hold off on this till later. Might. Main Quest 2 only requires 3 Isartu, and the 20-Isartu quest is pretty deep in.

### River Water For…? - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** Riza MQ6/Journey Upriver
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 10 River Water
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest, 1 Wooden Key, & 1 Leafsung Ink
- **Recommendations:** Do you have extra River Water lying around after all the Dí requirements in the main quests? Then sure! Otherwise, give it a pass for now.

### Rudakai Master - Balance

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Unlocked by:** Balance MQ5/The Water Calls
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Rudakai, 3 Desert Rudakai, and 3 Water Rudakai
- **Rewards:** 5 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** Do this after you've gotten as many River Chests and Keys as you're likely to get in the game, because you'll need Reinforced Rope to battle the Water Rudakai. (Well, as many River Chests and Keys as you're likely to get apart from Steel (Or Brace) Yourself; Reinforced Steel gear is very Reinforced-Rope expensive.) More travels ahead! Enjoy.

# Side Quests, in Alphabetical Order: S

LAST UPDATED 28 FEB 2021

### Sacred Feathers - Gansu

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Unlocked by:** 3PC MQ5/A Way South
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 10 Sacred Feathers
- **Rewards:** 3 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** If you're seeing this when you first get to Gansu and wondering how you do it, Step 1 is "get to the third Main Quest in Gansu". That's what makes Arenica available. Once you have that, this is exactly as valuable as Stempos are to you. How likely is it that you'll need to reserve days off for your streak, or make up a missed day? Is it worth 5 Steel Daggers and 6750 words (reduced by howevermuch your Attack is)? If so, go for it! Otherwise, it'll keep.

### Safety Hats - LF

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Unlocked by:** available at game open
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 20 Feathers
- **Rewards:** 1 Leaf Helmet
- **Recommendation:** Not really worth it. You'll probably get a Leaf Helmet in most Wooden Chest drops, and there's no urgent need to stockpile. If you're a completionist, be aware that saving this one for later means you might be able to complete it instantly, with stockpiles you gather on the way.

### Sagacious Sincere Sabu - RLab

- **Location:** Research Lab
- **Quest Path:** (open via Alien Expedition Trail: SpaceS Orders to Repair) • RLab Set Creatures Free! (1/4) • RLab Create a Clearing (2/4) • RLab Build a Biodome (3/4) • RLab Encourage an Ecosystem (4/4) • IN ANY ORDER [RLab Making Mellow Mowow  (*unlocks Mowow in Wilderness*)• **Sagacious Sincere Sabu (*unlocks Sabu in Wilderness*)** • RLab Silkly Sleek Sulanica (*unlocks Sulanica in Wilderness*)• RLab Zappy Zazzy Xombri (*unlocks Xombri in Wilderness*)• RLab Zooty Zanutaki Zings (*unlocks Zanutaki in Wilderness*)]
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 10 Fine Fabric, 5 Fur, and 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Rewards:** 1 Stempo, unlock Sabu
- **Recommendations:** I suspect you already have these on you, unless you've been doing something really intensive lately. And you certainly know places to find these resources by now. Good hunting!

### Sand in Places... - 3PC

- **Location:** Three Points Crossing
- **Unlocked by:** MT MQ4
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 50 Dust, 12 Reenu Wings, 35 Raw Fabric, 3 Rope, and 1 Steel Bar
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Caravan Sandals https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;featured&#95;sandals.png
- **Recommendations:** I love me my Caravan Sandals. I think they are among the cutest wardrobe items available so far in the game. If they're not all that from your perspective, this is definitely skippable. Bear in mind that you'll be wanting half a dozen Reenu Wings for other things later on, so you might want to go back and restock if this breaks the bank.

### Sand Mountain Caravan - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** MT MQ4 / Aid To An Elder
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Tambo
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest, 1 Wooden Key, 1 Leafsung Boots
- **Recommendation:** Think fighting a Tambo is intense? It is. But the rewards are great. You'll probably get a Wooden Chest for every Tambo you fight, and these are the only Leafsung Boots you'll get in the game without crafting them yourself. Do it if you can.

### Sands of Time - 3PC

- **Location:** Three Points Crossing
- **Unlocked by:** MT MQ4
- **Type:** Collection/Crafting
- **Requirements:** Collect 10 Sands Rings and 5 Glass Staffs
- **Rewards:** 5 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** Unless you're desperate for Stempos (lovely lovely streak-holders), this might be better to save until after Gansu Watering Hole. Later Chests drop materials that make part of this quest much easier. Meanwhile, you can start stocking up on the 10 Old Staffs you'll need to craft the Glass Staffs; Mama Tree Wooden Chests are especially good for Old Staffs (and again, you can't have too many Vine Nets from there if you want to complete all quests in this game).

### Sans the Bone - SurfaceC

- **Location:** Raina Surface Camp
- **Unlocked by:** Raina Expedition Trail: Raina Surface Camp (Riza quest)
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Auwi
- **Rewards:** 3 River Water and Wardrobe: Bone Nose Piercing https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;719-bone-nose-piercing-4712-76828.png
- **Recommendations:** This is great if you're trying to make some more Dí Bags, since you get not only the reward River Water but also the River Water dropped by the Auwi on the way. Otherwise, up to you.

### Save the Children

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Unlocked by:** available at game open
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 10 Essence and 10 Spider Poison
- **Rewards:** 2 Wooden Keys
- **Recommendation:** Not a priority, unless you're burning to find out what's inside your Wooden Chests. Aracni are still your best source of Spider Poison, and Wignow are your best source of Essence.

### Scary Short Story - PG

- **Location:** Purple Gate
- **Unlocked by:** PG MQ4/A Ruined Path
- **Type:** Battle, Wordcount
- **Requirements:** Write 10K words and defeat 1 each Poe, Cursed Hand, and Zhout
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hand Ankle Bracelet https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1209-hand-ankle-bracelet-8577-96142.png
- **Recommendations:** My recommendation for most Purple Gate sidequests is pretty uniform: take the quest if you like the reward, and you can figure out the rest!

### Scouting Lorsa - Balance

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Unlocked by:** Riza MQ6/Journey Upriver
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 5 Lorsa Nests
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest
- **Recommendations:** Depends on how many Lorsa Nests you've got on you. (Probably not a lot, and you'll have to travel back to the Desert or Forest to craft them.) Still, River Chests are pretty nice to have, and later sidequests will probably have you traveling anyway, so go for it when you're ready. (Unless, like me, you wish all Lorsa Nests would burn in the sun. Then wait till your anger cools a little.)

### Scouting The Land - SC

- **Location:** Stone City
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: FB Stone's Throw East
- **Type:** Words, Streak, Battle
- **Requirements:** Write 3,000 words, maintain a 3-day streak AFTER picking up quest, defeat 1 Sapilo, 1 Sapira, and 1 Sapiti 
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest
- **Recommendations:** I like the Sapi-beasts because they drop Spider Poison, and the other requirements aren't too irksome. This is a quick quest on the battle side, so why not?

### Scouting the Trees - TT

- **Location:** Tall Trees
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: FB Javelin Toss West
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Buholi, 1 Buhini, and 1 Buhovi; deliver 3 Vine Nets and 12 Rope
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest
- **Recommendations:** If you're doing Boots Made for Climbing, might as well double-dip. Watch the Vine Net and Rope levels, though; they become very important later in the game, and you don't want to wear yourself out getting them.

### Searching South - Ruins

- **Location:** Underground Ruins
- **Desert Expedition Trail:** (open via Gansu MQ8/Dust to Dust) • Gansu Digging Into Desert Sands • DigS Question to Axe • IN ANY ORDER: [ **Searching South** • Ruins Navigating North • Ruins Withdrawing West • Ruins Excavating East ] • Ruins Tunnel Locked On • (access to Shrine of Ages)
- **Type:** Words, Battle
- **Requirements:** Write 830 Words, defeat 1 Ripos
- **Rewards:** 5 Raw Gold, progress toward Shrine of Ages
- **Recommendations:** Do it. Ignore the wordcount, you'll get that many words anyway fighting Ripos. (Actually, might want to make sure you've taken all the other directional quests at the same time, so Ripos takes care of extra wordcount.)

### A Season for Hope - HuntS1

- **Location:** Elder Library 
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS1 Joining the Hunt
- **Type:** Words
- **Requirements:** Write 2020 words
- **Rewards:** 5 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Pick it up and have it fill itself in the background. Easy-peasy.

###A Secret Plan?  - HuntS1.2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Assassins & 1 Villager
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Eyepatch https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1532-hunt-cloth-eyepatch-10480-77717.png
- **Recommendations:**  Here, I'm torn between "this feels like a throwaway quest" and "but the lore hints sound important!" I'll just settle for "hey, look, Assassins drop lots of nifty things and make sure you fight the Villager in Mama Tree, where it won't cost you!"

### A Season to Explore - HuntS2

- **Location:** Elder Library 
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each:
  - Frizi
  - Kiru
  - Grult
  - Desert Wignow
  - Rulo
  - Yasri
  - Bruja
  - Villager
  - Tambo
  - Lombri
- **Rewards:** 100 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** That's 100 Hunter Tokens. That's quite a bit. (Although I'd detour to Mama Tree to fight the Villager, since it's cheaper there.) Go for it! Pro tip: if you haven't finished the Desert yet, you've got plenty of Bruja, Kiru, and Yasri ahead of you; don't go out of your way to fight them. Grult doesn't appear in any other quests, though (apart from Hunt quests).

### Seeding New Beginnings (1/3) - SacredS

- **Location:** Raina Sacred Site
- **Quest Path:** (open via Raina Expedition Trail: SwampL Twisted Treacherous Trails (2/2)) • **Seeding New Beginnings 1/3** • SacredS Seeding New Beginnings 2/3 • SacredS Seeding New Beginnings 3/3
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each:
  - Bashta
  - Minko
  - Toccal
- **Rewards:** 2 River Chests
- **Recommendations:** This makes all the other battling through worth it. River Chests ahoy! And the prospect of future things.

### Seeding New Beginnings (2/3) - SacredS

- **Location:** Raina Sacred Site
- **Quest Path:** (open via Raina Expedition Trail: SwampL Twisted Treacherous Trails (2/2)) • SacredS Seeding New Beginnings 1/3 • **Seeding New Beginnings 2/3** • SacredS Seeding New Beginnings 3/3
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 each:
  - Bashta
  - Minko
  - Toccal
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Seed Earrings https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;939-seed-earrings-6785-28324.png
- **Recommendations:** I quite like the earrings, and I like being thorough. I wouldn't prioritize this quest chain from here on out, though.

### Seeding New Beginnings (3/3) - SacredS

- **Location:** Raina Sacred Site
- **Quest Path:** (open via Raina Expedition Trail: SwampL Twisted Treacherous Trails (2/2)) • SacredS Seeding New Beginnings 1/3 • SacredS Seeding New Beginnings 2/3 • **Seeding New Beginnings 3/3** 
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 each:
  - Bashta
  - Minko
  - Toccal
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Gardener Hat https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;911-plant-hat-6506-66225.png
- **Recommendations:** Very fashionable, that hat, no? Worth 18,000 words?
  :) Now you'll know what everyone's been up to.

### Seeing a Sequence - ShrineGO

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Green Ooze Shrine Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat the following:
  - 1 Giant Ooze
  - 2 Giant Ooze Houses
  - 3 Wavi Ooze
  - 5 Wowtri Ooze
  - 8 Froji Ooze
- **Rewards:** 25 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** Make sure you've picked up Green Ooze Invasion to get max effectiveness.

### Seeing It Through - HuntS2

- **Location:** Elder Library 
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Frizi
- **Rewards:** 5 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** This is a little quest with a little reward. However, if Frizi end up dropping Hunter Tokens at any point, this will be well worth it. 

### Set Creatures Free! (1/4) - RLab

- **Location:** Research Lab
- **Quest Path:** (open via Alien Expedition Trail: SpaceS Orders to Repair) • **Set Creatures Free! (1/4)** • RLab Create a Clearing (2/4) • RLab Build a Biodome (3/4) • RLab Encourage an Ecosystem (4/4) • IN ANY ORDER [RLab Making Mellow Mowow  (*unlocks Mowow in Wilderness*)• RLab Sagacious Sincere Sabu (*unlocks Sabu in Wilderness*) • RLab Silkly Sleek Sulanica (*unlocks Sulanica in Wilderness*)• RLab Zappy Zazzy Xombri (*unlocks Xombri in Wilderness*)• RLab Zooty Zanutaki Zings (*unlocks Zanutaki in Wilderness*)]
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Captain Piak, 1 Dr. Enoe, 1 Dr. Hogglevoss, and 1 Rosarin
- **Rewards:** 5 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** This quest can't really be evaluated on its own, because it's all about the whole sequence. And I find the whole sequence rewarding, if challenging. It isn't possible to complete and get the ultimate reward until you're halfway through the Floating City of Balance in Oge-Mai, but why not give it a whirl?

### Shadows In Flux - GL

- **Location:** Guardian's Lair
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: FB North: Homeward Bound
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Gobkeys
- **Rewards:** 3 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** TAKE IT. The Stempos are an outstanding reward for 2K words of writing, and you'll want the Gobkey's drops if you ever want to see the Shrine of Ages.

### Shaman's Hideout

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** LF MQ4
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 8 Essence, 3 Claws, 12 Dust
- **Rewards:** 5 Leaf Boots
- **Recommendation:** Why not? Essence are easy to get from Wignow, if you did A Family Tree you'll probably have enough Claws, Dust isn't used for a ton of things, and Leaf Boots are nice to have for battles.

### A Shaman's Rope - DFO

- **Location:** Dark Forest Outpost
- **Quest Path:** (open via Balance MQ5/The Water Calls) • **A Shaman's Rope** • DFO Pieces for Peace
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 25 Rat Tails
- **Rewards:** 1 Bone Key
- **Recommendations:** This really dovetails well with Pit of Nightmares, which I highly recommend as the source of all your Rat Tail needs. It also unlocks another quest with a Bone Chest as a reward, so it's a nice source of resources.

### Shrine Creature Flyby - Shrine TFA

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Terror From Above Shrine Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each:
  - Murciel
  - Lupo
  - Fools' Lorsa
  - Fools' Lorsa Halloween
  - Arir
  - Witch's Memoirs
  - Untu Ship
- **Rewards:** 50 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** Isn't this why you're in the Shrine? Fight new monsters, win Shrine Stones? Go for it!

### The Shrine-Stone Trail - ShrineGiant

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Giants Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Caravans
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Tambo Mane https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;644-tambo-mane-3765-86009.png
- **Recommendations:** This monster is intimdating for low-output writers, but it's honestly not that bad. If you have >+21 Attack and >+15 Defense, it's less than 1K/day in actuality. If that's still too gruelling, write offsite and paste in. And if you're a high-output writer, glory in the great loot of the Caravan.

### Silent Slithering Surprises - PG

- **Location:** Purple Gate
- **Unlocked by:** PG MQ3/Keep Pushing Forward
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 50 Leopar
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Leopar Necklace https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1202-snake-necklace-8543-66886.png
- **Recommendations:** My recommendation for most Purple Gate sidequests is pretty uniform: take the quest if you like the reward, and you can figure out the rest!

### Silkly Sleek Sulanica

- **Location:** Research Lab
- **Quest Path:** (open via Alien Expedition Trail: SpaceS Orders to Repair) • RLab Set Creatures Free! (1/4) • RLab Create a Clearing (2/4) • RLab Build a Biodome (3/4) • RLab Encourage an Ecosystem (4/4) • IN ANY ORDER: [RLab Making Mellow Mowow  (*unlocks Mowow in Wilderness*)• RLab Sagacious Sincere Sabu (*unlocks Sabu in Wilderness*) • **Silkly Sleek Sulanica (*unlocks Sulanica in Wilderness*)**• RLab Zappy Zazzy Xombri (*unlocks Xombri in Wilderness*)• RLab Zooty Zanutaki Zings (*unlocks Zanutaki in Wilderness*)]
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 3 White Fur, 3 Sacred Feather, 5 Raw Fabric, and 10 Glass Shards
- **Rewards:** 1 Stempo, unlock Sulanica
- **Recommendations:** The process of gathering 3 White Fur and 3 Sacred Feathers should remind you how useful it could be to have a monster that consistently drops both for only a thousand words. Invaluable for Stempo production, once you've unlocked the ability to craft Stempos.

### Sing Your Bravery (2/2) - HuntS4

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Quest Path:** (open via Hunt Trail HuntS3 A Bubble Dream) • HuntS4 Sing Your Enthusiasm • **Sing Your Bravery 2/2** • HuntS4 Sing Your Commitment 3/4 • HuntS4 Sing Your Wander 4/4
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Cursed Hands
- **Rewards:** 15 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** As of this writing (quest has just been released), this is still the last quest in this chain and I don't know whether the chain will be worth any more than its obvious merits. Make your choices!

###Sing Your Commitment (3/4) - HuntS4

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Quest Path:** (open via Hunt Trail HuntS3 A Bubble Dream) • HuntS4 Sing Your Enthusiasm • HuntS4 Sing Your Bravery 2/2 • **Sing Your Commitment 3/4** • HuntS4 Sing Your Wander 4/4
- **Type:** Streak
- **Requirements:** Attain a 15-day Streak
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  It's a bit tedious. But the satisfaction of cleaning out this chain...

### Sing Your Enthusiasm - HuntS4

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Quest Path:** (open via Hunt Trail HuntS3 A Bubble Dream) • **Sing Your Enthusiasm** • HuntS4 Sing Your Bravery 2/2 • HuntS4 Sing Your Commitment 3/4 • HuntS4 Sing Your Wander 4/4
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Zanthei
- **Rewards:** 20 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** I think Team Zanthei is getting a shoutout here! If you pick this up while Zanthei is dropping Hunter Tokens, those tokens will add up to effectively triple the reward on this quest.

###Sing Your Wander (4/4) - HuntS4

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Quest Path:** (open via Hunt Trail HuntS3 A Bubble Dream) • HuntS4 Sing Your Enthusiasm • HuntS4 Sing Your Bravery 2/2 • HuntS4 Sing Your Commitment 3/4 • **Sing Your Wander 4/4**
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each: Wignow, Desert Wignow, Dust Wignow, Spirit Wignow, and Swamp Wignow
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Facepaint Around Eye https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;660-hunt-facepaint-around-eye-3951-47167.png
- **Recommendations:**  See what else you can get going for you while you're on this one. It involves a fair amount of travel, although 160 Coins will pay for you to make a one-way trip across the Valley, and 320 will pay for a round trip, so this might be worth shelling out for.

### Sleepless in Stone City - SC

- **Location:** Stone City
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: FB Stone's Throw East
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 8 Sapilo & 8 Oncaiii
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Sapiemon Necklace [https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;979-monkey-necklace-7096-75774.png](https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;979-monkey-necklace-7096-75774.png)
- **Recommendations:** It's a little pricey, once you factor in the invisible Kaija costs, but it is a lovely necklace and they are fun beasties to battle.

### Slowest Tortoise Wins - SC

- **Location:** Stone City
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: FB Stone's Throw East
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 12 Reudod
- **Rewards:** 2 Wooden Chests & 2 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** A very nice reward, but I admit I'm partial to these tortoises and I like an excuse to fight them.

### Snake Pit - Gansu

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Unlocked by:** 3PC MQ5/A Way South
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 25 Ylly
- **Rewards:** 5 Gold Bars
- **Recommendations:** Do it whenever you have a chance, if you like long sidequests at all. The Gold Bars are a lackluster prize, but at least it's *some* extra prize while you earn Ylly's drops, which are invaluable in later quests.

### Something Extraordinary - HuntS4

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail HuntS3 A Bubble Dream
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Mirdor
- **Rewards:** Hunt Map Piece 10 and 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** The description for this quest will outright tell you that Mirdor is in Guardian's Lair. The Bard seems to be all over the game!

### Sparks to Ignite (3/3) - SpaceS

- **Location:** Spaceship
- **Quest Path:** (open via Alien Expedition Trail: IC Learning to Breathe) • SpaceS An Alien Exam (Part 1 of 2) • SpaceS Studying Space Scientists (Part 2 of 2) • **Sparks to Ignite (3/3)** 
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 each:
  - Szalin
  - Nedi
  - Skarn
  - Rosarin
  - Ame
  - Dr. Hogglevoss
  - Zals
  - Dr. Enoe
  - Fonar
  - Tessen
  - Minica
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: OnFire Lab Coat https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1105-onfire-lab-coat-7962-37242.png
- **Recommendations:** You've come this far! ... who am I kidding, at 84K battle words, this is one of the most demanding quests in the game. Still, it provides a nice long-term thing to have in the background when the frenzied rush of short-term quests has subsided.

### Spider Bows - Riza

- **Location:** Riza Rivertown
- **Unlocked by:** Riza MQ6/Journey Upriver
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Turn in 25 Spider Bows
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Key & 1 Stone Chest
- **Recommendations:** Definitely worth turning in if you have 25 Spider Bows or more already. If you're going to tackle the Raina quests, you'll probably accrue all the Spider Bows you need later while using Wooden Chests in Mama Tree to get Vine Nets. Probably no reason to specifically farm Spider Bows for it, though.

### Spooky Scary Supernaturals - ShrineMar

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Marionette Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each: Osemar, Zosimos, Zosimaga, Zosimas, Zosimalus, Balatros, Balatrix, Balatras
- **Rewards:** 50 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** None needed

### Spreading Hope - HuntS1

- **Location:** Elder Library 
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS1 Joining the Hunt
- **Type:** Forum
- **Requirements:** Post 3 Messages in the Forum
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** I mean, I like the Forums quite a lot; I don't see the downside. Post away! If you're still starting out and wanting to avoid the Forums as much as possible, I'd combine this with the One Of Us sidequest in Luciola Forest and Tribe Member sidequest in Mama Tree.

### A Squirming Nest - DigS

- **Location:** Dig Site
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Gansu Digging Into Desert Sands
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 100 Loi
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Lombri Hat https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1033-lombri-hat-7567-63630.png
- **Recommendations:** Well, it's not a priority for me because I prefer shorter to-do lists even if they're large chunks, but it would be nice to just set Loi on an infinity loop for a while and see how much of this gets knocked out.

### Stabbing Dinti Spikes - IC

- **Location:** Impact Crater
- **Unlocked by:** Alien Meteoroid Trail: 3PC A Way North: Up The Mountain
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Krang, 3 Erbor, 10 Halix, and 4 Galatre
- **Rewards:** 3 Stempos & Wardrobe: Rock Skirt https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;885-rock-skirt-6154-61176.png
- **Recommendations:** This quest involves 3 monsters from much deeper in the Alien Meteoroid, but it could be nice to get all the Erbor stuff out of the way together.

### Stamina Level Up! - SurfaceC

- **Location:** Raina Surface Camp
- **Unlocked by:** Raina Expedition Trail: Raina Surface Camp (Riza quest)
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 15 Vaktra
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest & Wardrobe: Moss Hat https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;727-moss-hat-4772-99897.png
- **Recommendations:** Up to you! No secret ins or outs here.

### State of Rest - HuntS2

- **Location:** Elder Library 
- **Quest Path:** (open via Hunt Trail: HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library) • HuntS2 Guarding the Path • **State of Rest** • HuntS2 A Distant Figure
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Pipit
- **Rewards:** Hunt Map Piece 5, 5 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** We've settled into a pattern where one Ancient's Assistant quest unlocks another, which unlocks another, and provides Map Pieces to further the Hunt. Have fun getting to know Pipit and progressing in the Hunt! Don't forget to check off the Oh, Endless Possibilities quest when you're done!

### Steel Boots - SurfaceC

(THIS IS MUCH LONGER THAN USUAL; bear with me.)

- **Location:** Raina Surface Camp
- **Unlocked by:** Raina Expedition Trail: Raina Surface Camp (Riza quest)
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Pay 25 Steel Boots
- **Rewards:** 1 Dust Water (what's this good for? Who knows? Nothing yet.) and 3 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** THE EVIL QUEST OF EVIL. This is OBSCENELY expensive. 
  - Each Steel Boot needs 3 Steel Bars and 1 Fabric Boot (among other items) to build. Each Fabric Boot needs 100 Coins, 3 Leafsung Boots, some Fine Fabric, Raw Fabric, and a Steel Bar to build. Each Leafsung Boot requires 2 Leaf Boots and 1 Leafsung Ink to build. Each Leafsung Ink requires 5 Essence, 5 Spider Poison, 3 Claws, and 3 Dust. 
  - So in short, if you drill down, each Steel Boot requires that you build one Fabric Boot, from Leafsung Boots, from Leaf Boots and Leafsung Ink, and Steel Bars, which means each Steel Boot needs 100 Coins, 9 Claws, 9 Dust, 15 Essence, 1 Fine Fabric, 6 Leaf Boots, 45 Leaves, 4 Raw Fabric, 2 River Grass, 15 Spider Poison, and 4 Steel Bars, which very likely will need to be made from 12 Raw Steel and 12 Wood.
  - EACH. BOOT.
  - First: make sure you've completed River Grass Supply in Riza to get the cheapest pair of Steel Boots in the game.
  - Second: make sure you've completed the Tailor quest in 3PC for the cheapest pair of Fabric Boots in the game.
  - Third: consider redoing the entire game a few times to chalk up a few more of these cheaper boots, because they're less mind-numbing than farming all the necessary materials.
    - If you decide just to take the quest right now after doing First and Second parts, you'll need 2300 Coins, 207 Claws, 207 Dust, 345 Essence, 23 Fine Fabric, 138 Leaf Boots, 1035 Leaves,  92 Raw Fabric, 48 River Grass, 345 Spider Poison (which will, at the best efficiency, require 138,000 battle-words in 345 battles against Aracni), and 95 Steel Bars, and all you get for it will be one. single. Dust Water, which has no apparent use so far and can't be sold. Consider very carefully.
    - Seriously, consider completing this quest on a later pass. It'll be less tedious spread over completing other quests.
  - Fourth: Make sure you've completed the Make &#95; Sing series of quests in Luciola Forest so you'll be able to craft Leafsung Ink in Mama Tree. (Don't waste any of your winnings on the Leafsung Vial Creation in Mama Tree at present, if you haven't yet.)
  - Fifth: You'll need bunches of Leafsung Ink for a later sidequest with a far niftier reward. Don't burn yourself out farming that now, if you haven't checked out Balance yet.
  - **Fifth and a half**: Golden Chests and River Chests just started dropping Leafsung Ink. I'm not completely rewriting this section the way I possibly should in light of this, because this means that fighting Arenica and Suulan and Desert Rudakai just became relevant to this quest, as well as * spoiler * in the Floating City of Balance. 
  - **Fifth and three quarters**: Look, just ignore the rest and come back after you've gotten far enough through Balance to find a consistent source of River Chests and River Keys, because you might just want to farm all your Leafsung Ink that way.
  - Sixth: Spider Poison will be the most demanding thing to farm, if you decide to manufacture Leafsung Ink the old-fashioned way, because you absolutely cannot get it except from a battle or a Luciola Wooden Chest. (Essence, Leaves, and Steel Bars will probably be the next-most-demanding bits). Spider Poison is best gotten from Aracni in Luciola Forest, but Illi in Mama Tree and Ylly in Gansu will give you Rope at the same time (needed for a lot of other things in the game) and some much-needed variety. Illi stack well with Tylu, which will get you Claws for the Leafsung Ink. Ylly will also help you gather Raw Fabric.
  - Seventh: So, the Steel Bars. Yasri in 3PC drop them directly, and also drop Fine Fabric that you'll need, and extra Raw Steel to help polish off. If you get tired of them, Rulo drop Raw Steel in nice quantities.
  - Eighth: Essence and Leaves can come from Desert Wignow, which conveniently also drop the Desert Stones that are in such high demand for Gansu sidequests.
  - Good luck, and may the Force be with you.

### Steel (Or Brace) Yourself - Balance

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Unlocked by:** Riza MQ6/Journey Upriver
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 5 Reinforced Steel Helmets and 5 Reinforced Steel Breastplates
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest and 1 River Key
- **Recommendations:** Not now. For one, you'll definitely want to equip yourself with the first R.S. Helmet and Breastplate you can get, so you functionally need 6 of each. For another, 1 River Chest and 1 River Key are nowhere near as valuable as the items you're trading for them. But when you're running out of sidequests, this is a fun one to try to push through.

### Steel Weapons - Riza

- **Location:** Riza Rivertown
- **Unlocked by:** Riza MQ3/Remedy for a Friend
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Craft & turn in 5 Steel Maces and 10 Steel Shields
- **Rewards:** 3 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** Biggest resource suck up to this point in the game. Even for completionists, I'd wait until all Main Quests were finished before tackling this one. Probably most of the sidequests, too. Much better to craft a Steel Mace to use yourself.

### Step Into The Deadlands (1/4) - DFO

- **Location:** Dark Forest Outpost
- **Quest Path:** (open via DFO MQ12/Well of Lost Souls) • **Step Into The Deadlands (1/4)** • DFO Hounding the Dead (2/4) • DFO Message in a Spirit (3/4) • DFO Flutters Shy & High (4/4)
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Papple Spirits
- **Rewards:** 1 Staff of the Dead
- **Recommendations:** This series culminates in my favorite ever Wardrobe reward (see Flutters Shy & High), and Papple Spirits have the great virtue (great in my opinion, anyway) of Not Having Any Price Tag Other Than Words. The reward is a Weapon2 I can take or leave, but it's great for anyone trying to max Luck.

### Sticks & Stones - ShrineGiant

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Giants Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Skuppa's Giant Marionette and 5 Untu Golem
- **Rewards:** 25 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** This is the second-easiest quest in this area, and you'll end up with 75 Shrine Stones including the ones you net from battles. Go for it!

###Sticky, Sweet, and Alluring  - HuntS1.2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 15 Reenu and 5 Nitana
- **Rewards:** 15 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  For the love of the flight (convenient that this quest is released when flying monsters are dropping Hunter Tokens!) Go for it!

###Still Missing Something - HuntS4

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Hunt Trail Route:** (unlocked via LF MQ4/Don't Regift Curses) • MT The Winding Path to Elder Library • HuntS1 Joining the Hunt • HuntS1 The Hunt Begins • HuntS1 Deeper Forest Hunting • HuntS1 A Past Not Forgotten • HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library • HuntS2 All Who Wander • HuntS2 Oh, Endless Possibilities! • HuntS2 No Wrong Path • Hunt S2 Stumbling Upon Sheep • HuntS3 To Grow & Change • HuntS3 Bettering Ourselves • HuntS3 Bigger & Brighter • HuntS3 A Bubble Dream • HuntS4 Dirt to Dust • HuntS4 Celebrate Joy • **Still Missing Something** • HuntS4 Proving Your Friendship
- **Type:** Streak, Collection
- **Requirements:** Attain 10-day Streak, deliver all 11 Hunt Map Pieces
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Map Hands https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;872-hunt-map-hands-6024-61497.png
- **Recommendations:**  This unlocks the Bard and the end of the first year of the Hunt! Alas, it will take all your Hunt Map Pieces away (or "hurrah", if you were weirded out by that huge chunk in your inventory), but at least you'll have a Map in hand.

### Stingy Surprise - Balance

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Unlocked by:** Balance MQ1/ Help From A Master
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 30 Nuig
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: River Grass Skirt
- **Recommendations:** On one hand: that's a lot of Nuig, and a lot of Water Masks to battle them. On the other hand: that is a lovely skirt. Consider picking up this one at the same time as Elemental Powers and Venomous Villains and the start of Main Quest 3, and then you can knock out 30 Nuig and never touch them again.

### Stone City Chaos - SC

- **Location:** Stone City
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: FB Stone's Throw East
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 each Sapilo, Sapira, Sapiti, and Reudod
- **Rewards:** 4 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** I hope you're looking for overlap, because this quest overlaps with pretty much every other quest in Stone City. If you haven't gotten far in the Desert yet, the Stempos are irresistibly available here. Look! Ways to pause your streak!

### Stone Collector - Gansu

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Unlocked by:** 3PC MQ5/A Way South
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 100 Desert Stones
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest & 1 Stone Key
- **Recommendations:** If this will be quick, or you like hunting Desert Stones, go for it! Be aware, though, that there are a LOT of Desert Stone requirements in both main and sidequests for a while, and you might want to wait on spending what you have. (And there's an easier sidequest with the same rewards if you wait a bit.)

### Stone's Throw East - FB

- **Location:** Forward Base
- **Forest Expedition Trail Route:** (open via MT MQ4 / Aid To An Elder) • MT New Adventurous Horizons •  BC Hard Day's Walk • FB Feeding the Lighthouse • IN ANY ORDER [FB Javelin Toss West • FB North: Homeward Bound • **Stone's Throw East**]
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 10 Ardi Lamps
- **Rewards:** Unlock Stone City area
- **Recommendations:** If you're on a roll, prioritize this one: the region has some quests that are nice to collect early and have in the background while you're opening up.

### Stop Clowning Around - ShrineMar

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Marionette Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 each: Balatros, Balatrix, Balatras
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Clown Eyes https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;clown&#95;eyes.png
- **Recommendations:** None needed

###Stories to Tell - HuntS4

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail HuntS3 A Bubble Dream
- **Type:** Wordcount
- **Requirements:** Write 25K Words
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** I am never one to turn down wordcount quests, because you can always add to them while you're doing other things.

### Strengthening Your Adaptiveness 5/5 - HuntS2

- **Location:** Elder Library 
- **Quest Path:** (open via Hunt Trail: HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library) • HuntS2 Strengthening Your Loyalty • HuntS2 Strengthening Your Viewpoint 2/3 • HuntS2 Strengthening Your Friendship 3/3 • HuntS2 Strengthening Your Timing 4/5 • **Strengthening Your Adaptiveness 5/5** 
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Kapir
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Chest Side Belts https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;657-chest-side-belts-3903-85263.png
- **Recommendations:** Note that Kapir are also required for Dazzling Desert Diversity, so consider having that at the ready. Otherwise... you're good!

### Strengthening Your Friendship 3/3 - HuntS2

- **Location:** Elder Library 
- **Quest Path:** (open via Hunt Trail: HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library) • HuntS2 Strengthening Your Loyalty • HuntS2 Strengthening Your Viewpoint 2/3 • **Strengthening Your Friendship 3/3** • HuntS2 Strengthening Your Timing 4/5 • HuntS2 Strengthening Your Adaptiveness 5/5
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Wetu (Gansu)
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** 3 Wetu are a cinch if you're used to writing >1000 words/day; they're a bit more of a challenge if you're on the slower side. Feel free to wait and watch on this one.

### Strengthening Your Loyalty - HuntS2

- **Location:** Elder Library 
- **Quest Path:** (open via Hunt Trail: HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library) • **Strengthening Your Loyalty** • HuntS2 Strengthening Your Viewpoint 2/3 • HuntS2 Strengthening Your Friendship 3/3 • HuntS2 Strengthening Your Timing 4/5 • HuntS2 Strengthening Your Adaptiveness 5/5
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Grult
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** EDITED 24 Apr 2020 - Suspicions justified! Currently 3 quests in this chain. Original recommendation: I'm suspicious. The naming convention sounds a bit like the "Proving Your..." series from Season 1 - will this become a series? Or does "wandering" mean fewer sequential things? It's a pretty small quest, in the end, and hey, Grult are the most efficient sources of XP in the game right now.

### Strengthening Your Timing 4/5 - HuntS2

- **Location:** Elder Library 
- **Quest Path:** (open via Hunt Trail: HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library) • HuntS2 Strengthening Your Loyalty • HuntS2 Strengthening Your Viewpoint 2/3 • HuntS2 Strengthening Your Friendship 3/3 • **Strengthening Your Timing 4/5** • HuntS2 Strengthening Your Adaptiveness 5/5
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Ripos
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Pretty self-evident. If you manage to knock this out this month (before 24 June 2020), Ripos will be dropping Hunter Tokens, too, so it'll get you 28. Good time to tackle it.

### Strengthening Your Viewpoint 2/3 - HuntS2

- **Location:** Elder Library 
- **Quest Path:** (open via Hunt Trail: HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library) • HuntS2 Strengthening Your Loyalty • **Strengthening Your Viewpoint 2/3** • HuntS2 Strengthening Your Friendship 3/3 • HuntS2 Strengthening Your Timing 4/5 • HuntS2 Strengthening Your Adaptiveness 5/5
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each:
  - Rulo (3PC, Gansu)
  - Sparfly (Gansu, Riza)
  - Ylly (Gansu)
  - Desert Wignow (3PC, Gansu)
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** I KNEW IT! I knew Strengthening Your Loyalty was part 1 of a chain! If this is parallel to Season 1, then this quest chain will have mediocre rewards until it ends, at which point you might have some very cool wardrobe in store. Might. Anyway, I like that several of these monsters have valuable drops and none of them have requirements; go for it!

### Study Break Time - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Quest Path:** (open via Gansu MQ8) • Gansu Rebuild the Watering Hole • Gansu Respark the Flame • Gansu Local Shrine • Gansu First Stempo • (ability to craft Stempos), **Study Break Time** 
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Pay 10 Stempos
- **Rewards:** 3 Wooden Keys & 3 Wooden Chests
- **Recommendations:** Before Wooden Chests were added to the rewards, my recommendation was as follows: "For completionists only. 10 Stempos are ridiculously more valuable than 3 Wooden Keys, so unless you have dozens on hand you don't expect to use or you're desperate to complete every. single. quest… skip this."
  Now that Wooden Chests have been added, my recommendation is... pretty much the same. It's no longer insanely imbalanced, but the average player will get more use out of 10 Stempos than 3 Wooden Key/Chest pairs. Unless you have 10 Stempos you won't otherwise use, which is possible if you've accumulated a lot.

### Studying Space Scientists (Part 2 of 2) - SpaceS

NOTE: This exact quest was offered during the Alien Meteoroid Expedition in July 2020; if you completed it then, it will not be available now.

- **Location:** Spaceship
- **Quest Path:** (open via Alien Expedition Trail: IC Learning to Breathe) • SpaceS An Alien Exam (Part 1 of 2) • **Studying Space Scientists (Part 2 of 2)** • SpaceS Sparks to Ignite (3/3)
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 2 each: 
  - Nedi
  - Skarn
  - Szalin
  - Rosarin
  - Ame
  - Dr. Hogglevoss
  - Zals
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Graffiti Lab Coat https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;944-grafitti-lab-coat-6855-53845.png
- **Recommendations:** No rush at the moment! Take when you like, finish what you like.

### Studying Substance Samples - HuntS1

- **Location:** Elder Library 
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS1 Joining the Hunt
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 50 Dust
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** I don't know about you, but I'm always overloaded on Dust. This is an easy YES.

### Stumbling Upon Sheep - HuntS2

- **Location:** Elder Library 
- **Hunt Trail Route:** (unlocked via LF MQ4/Don't Regift Curses) • MT The Winding Path to Elder Library • HuntS1 Joining the Hunt • HuntS1 The Hunt Begins • HuntS1 Deeper Forest Hunting • HuntS1 A Past Not Forgotten • HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library • HuntS2 All Who Wander • HuntS2 Oh, Endless Possibilities! • HuntS2 No Wrong Path • **Stumbling Upon Sheep** • HuntS3 To Grow & Change • HuntS3 Bettering Ourselves • HuntS3 Bigger & Brighter • HuntS3 A Bubble Dream • HuntS4 Dirt to Dust • HuntS4 Celebrate Joy • HuntS4 Still Missing Something • HuntS4 Proving Your Friendship
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Shepherd
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Dog Mentor Pet https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;862-dog-mentor-pet-6004-63771.png
- **Recommendations:** This is the end of the Season 2 quests! And the Pipit pet is ADORABLE. Beat that Shepherd down!

### Sturdy Wooden Fence - FB

- **Location:** Forward Base
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: BC Hard Day's Walk
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 25 Wood and 15 Rope
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendations:** If you've been playing long enough to get this far, you don't need my recommendation. Obvious tradeoffs. I wouldn't do this without having at least 10x the needed amount on hand, personally - the resources are too valuable.

### Style is Eternal

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Quest Path Route:** available at game open • LF Make It Work • **Style Is Eternal** 
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 10 Feathers, 15 Reenu Wings, 5 Lorsa Fur
- **Rewards:** 3 Wooden Keys
- **Recommendation:** Are you telling me you don't want those Wooden Keys? But note that you cannot get Lorsa Fur in Luciola Forest; you'll need to go to Mama Tree for that. You can also get Feathers in the same place as Lorsa Fur.

### Submerged Spikey Swim (1/2) - CAVE

- **Location:** Cave
- **Quest Path:** (open via CAVE MQ 6/Speak with Shadow) • **Submerged Spikey Swim 1/2** • CAVE Submerged Spikey Swim 2/2
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Letos, 8 Ulos, and 10 Spina
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Spina Necklace https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1262-fish-necklace-8912-88199.png
- **Recommendations:** This gets a boilerplate "sure, if you like! Maybe keep an eye out for overlaps?"

### Submerged Spikey Swim (2/2)

- **Location:** Cave
- **Quest Path:** (open via CAVE MQ 6/Speak with Shadow) • CAVE Submerged Spikey Swim 1/2 • **Submerged Spikey Swim 2/2**
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Letos, 20 Ulos, and 30 Spina
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Ulos Mask https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1272-starfish-mask-8952-26047.png
- **Recommendations:** This gets a boilerplate "sure, if you like! Maybe keep an eye out for overlaps?"

### Swing, Sway, Summon - TT

- **Location:** Tall Trees
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: FB Javelin Toss West
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 25 Feathers
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest, 1 Wooden Key
- **Recommendations:** I would pick this up when you have 25 Feathers to spare. (And by this point, you'll be able to guess when you have 25 Feathers to spare.) I would not put myself out grinding Feathers at this point.

# Side Quests, in Alphabetical Order: T-Z

LAST UPDATED 5 MAR 2021

### Tailor - 3PC

- **Location:** Three Points Crossing
- **Unlocked by:** MT MQ4
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 30 Red Dye
- **Rewards:**1 Fabric Boots, 3 Stone Keys, 1 Stempo
- **Recommendations:** Definitely do this, but I wouldn't actively pursue it till you're done with the Three Points Crossing Main Quests. Red Dye tends to slowly accumulate as you play, and you'll get a better feel for the best sources as you work your way around the Desert. (Oh, and if you're wondering what Stone Keys are… they're Keys, what more do you need to know right now???)

###Tallest of Trees  - HuntS1.2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Buhini, 5 Buhovi and 3 Buholi
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens and Wardrobe: Hunt Earrings Sword Shield https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1588-hunt-earings-sword-shield-11798-73484.png 
- **Recommendations:**  Bear in mind that you'll need 29 Nezthai Claws to complete this, which will probably mean 20-25 Nezthai battles as well, few of which will involve other quests. On the other hand, you get those really nifty earrings (you can switch which ear gets which earring, too, although it always has to be both and they always have to be different). Make sure there aren't any Buh-beast quests you want to do at the same time!

### Tambo Snacks - Balance

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Unlocked by:** Riza MQ6/Journey Upriver
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 100 Caricaco
- **Rewards:** 5 River Keys
- **Recommendations:** Consider mixing this with River Landwalkers whenever you do it (that's 25 Caricaco overlap you're looking at), but also consider saving both of them for later on. These are the kind of long-term battle quests that are worth saving to go in the background while you're collecting five billion Spider Poison for another quest.

### Tears and Feathers - ShrineCar

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Carnival Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Halores
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Carnival Mask https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;646-carnival-mask-3781-45288.png
- **Recommendations:** I happen to adore the mask and recommend going for this as a priority. It does have only the one variant, so it's not like there's a chance of getting a different one you like better, but... fun! Also, I like all the Carnival monsters, so fighting 5 Halores is an appealing prospect.

### Technology & Dinti - SpaceS

- **Location:** Spaceship
- **Alien Expedition Trail:** (open via 3PC MQ5/A Way South) • 3PC A Way North: Up The Mountain • IC Learning to Breathe • IN ANY ORDER: [**Technology & Dinti** • SpaceS Orders to Repair]
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 20 Wood, 5 Steel, 20 Rope, and 5 Stone
- **Rewards:** Unlock Mining Site
- **Recommendations:** This unlocks the way to the Dinti Shop, for anyone who didn't clear it out initially. Definitely worth a look.

### Testing the Valley - RLab

- **Location:** Research Lab
- **Unlocked by:** Alien Expedition Trail: SpaceS Orders to Repair
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Dr. Enoe, and deliver:
  - 3 Reenu Wings
  - 2 Spider Poison
  - 3 Nuig String
  - 1 Vezi Shell
  - 10 Bones
  - 2 Refined Dust
  - 2 Kapir Tuft
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Drill Bracelet https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1092-drill-bracelet-7908-26970.png
- **Recommendations:** This is A Lot for a relatively small reward.  The items range from Luciola Forest (Reenu Wings) to Dark Forest Outpost (Bones) with a sidestep into Desert Expedition (Kapir Tuft). So it's mostly a matter of pride to deliver, and a use for items you might happen to accumulate as you close out the main quest sequence. (At least the Drill Bracelet comes in Left, Right, and Both Wrists?)

### There She Blows - ShrineGO

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Green Ooze Shrine Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Whaly Ooze
- **Rewards:** 25 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** Don't forget about the Green Ooze Invasion quest while you're here!

### Thieving Glowing Rocks - MSite

- **Location:** Mining Site
- **Unlocked by:** Alien Expedition Trail: SpaceS Technology & Dinti
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Ityf
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Exoskeleton https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1093-exoeskeleton-7914-33237.png
- **Recommendations:** There are a lot of quests here that need no extra recommendations, so here's a boilerplate to say this is one of them. :)

### Thinking Like Ink (4/5) - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via MT MQ 4/ Aid To An Elder) • MT Tinkering With Leafsung (1/5) • MT Inking By Number (2/5) • MT Inking of Dust (3/5) • **Thinking of Ink (4/5)** • MT The Invisible Ink (5/5)
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** 10 Vezi Shells, 15 Nuig String, 100 River Grass, 10 Dí Bags, and 5 Xyplos Ink 
- **Rewards:** 3 Leafsung Keys, unlock The Invisible Ink (5/5)
- **Recommendations:** Make no mistake, as wonderful as Leafsung Keys are, these particular ones aren't worth the ingredients on their own; it's all about working toward the Leafsung Tattoos in the end. And if some of the ingredients look unfamiliar, you're probably not far enough in the Floating City of Balance yet. But if you've gotten this far, it'd be silly not to see the whole thing through!

### Those Nightly Terrors - Shrine TFA

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Terror From Above Shrine Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Murciel and 5 Lupo
- **Rewards:** 25 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** You know what to do. Do it with style.

### Time of Reflection - HuntS1

- **Location:** Elder Library 
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS1 Joining the Hunt
- **Type:** Streak
- **Requirements:** Maintain a 4-day Streak
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** You'll be doing other quests requiring streaks as long or longer; might as well do this at the same time. (Hint: The Hunt Begins is one of those quests.)

### Tinkering With Leafsung (1/5) - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via MT MQ 4/ Aid To An Elder)  • **Tinkering With Leafsung (1/5)** • MT Inking By Number (2/5) • MT Inking of Dust (3/5) • MT Thinking of Ink (4/5) • MT The Invisible Ink (5/5)
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Aracni, 5 Wignow, 5 Lorsa, 5 Mawt, and 5 Buhini
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest, unlock Inking By Number (2/5) (this is a 5-quest series which is actually not possible to complete until all Oge-Mai regions have been unlocked and most of the main quests completed)
- **Recommendations:** Go ahead and get started on this project if you want! The quest series culminates in a lovely Leafsung Ink Tattoo wardrobe item and gives nice little rewards along the way. Your difficulty at this stage will be finding Buhini: they are in the Expedition area, a bonus region. You will need to complete the New Adventure Horizons side quest to unlock the Base Camp in Expedition, and then you will *further* need to complete A Hard Day's Walk in Base Camp to unlock Forward Base in Expedition, and then Feeding the Lighthouse in Forward Base to unlock the ability to craft Ardi Lamps, and then Javelin Toss West to open Stone Trees, which is the home of Buhini. Whew. That was a lot. And that's not even getting into the materials and things you'll need to craft them. TL;DR: Take this at your own pace, no need to rush.

### Tinkering With Trinkets - LF

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Unlocked by:** MT MQ 2/ A Secret Message
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 5 Rusty Amulets and 5 Rusty Pendants
- **Rewards:** 50 Coins
- **Recommendation:** The numbers don't work in the slightest; the materials are easily worth 50 coins, especially now that Rusty Amulets no longer drop as rewards. But if it's satisfying, and/or if you're piling up more Rusty Pendants than you know what to do with, here you go.

### To Celebrate and Share - Hunt S4

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail HuntS3 A Bubble Dream
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 6 Takori
- **Rewards:** 20 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** I'm not sure what Takori have to do with celebration (unless we're celebrating escaping them?), but hey, ours is not to question why, right?

### To Collect Memories - FB

- **Location:** Forward Base
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: BC Hard Day's Walk
- **Type:** Wordcount, Streak
- **Requirements:** Write 10000 words, attain 10-day Streak
- **Rewards:** 5 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** 5 Stempos are not to be sneezed at, and the wordcount part takes care of itself. 

### To Grow & Change - HuntS3

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Hunt Trail Route:** (unlocked via LF MQ4/Don't Regift Curses) • MT The Winding Path to Elder Library • HuntS1 Joining the Hunt • HuntS1 The Hunt Begins • HuntS1 Deeper Forest Hunting • HuntS1 A Past Not Forgotten • HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library • HuntS2 All Who Wander • HuntS2 Oh, Endless Possibilities! • HuntS2 No Wrong Path • Hunt S2 Stumbling Upon Sheep • **To Grow & Change** • HuntS3 Bettering Ourselves • HuntS3 Bigger & Brighter • HuntS3 A Bubble Dream • HuntS4 Dirt to Dust • HuntS4 Celebrate Joy • HuntS4 Still Missing Something • HuntS4 Proving Your Friendship
- **Type:** Collection, Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 of any monster, collect Hunt Map Piece 7
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Facepaint Side https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;667-hunt-facepaint-side-4049-28215.png
- **Recommendations:** Make sure you've got the Moving Flora quest, and this will mostly handle itself!

### To Hope is to Plan - HuntS1

- **Location:** Elder Library 
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS1 Joining the Hunt
- **Type:** Wordcount
- **Requirements:** Write 10K words
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Go ahead and pick this up right away; wordcount quests are ALWAYS good to have going on in the background

### Too Many Spirits - PG

- **Location:** Purple Gate
- **Unlocked by:** PG MQ2/A Desolate Path
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 25 Eninir
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Eninir Crown https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1208-ghost-crown-8575-76537.png
- **Recommendations:** My recommendation for most Purple Gate sidequests is pretty uniform: take the quest if you like the reward, and you can figure out the rest!

### Tougher With Tambo - Gansu

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Unlocked by:** 3PC MQ5/A Way South
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 250 Wood, 100 Rope, 25 Stone
- **Rewards:** 3 Stone Chests and 3 Stone Keys
- **Recommendations:** These are great rewards, but you'll be wanting a lot of Wood, Rope, and Stone Blocks for a series of quests unlocked at the end of Gansu. Consider waiting on this one till you finish Riza Rivertown if grinding bugs you.

### Tracking Shooting Stars - SpaceS

- **Location:** Spaceship
- **Unlocked by:** Alien Expedition Trail: IC Learning to Breathe
- **Type:** Streak
- **Requirements:** Reach 15 Streak Days in a row
- **Rewards:** 3 Stempos & Wardrobe: Speed Visor https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;speed&#95;visor&#95;blue.png
- **Recommendations:** Pick it up and win easy.

### Train the Guards - SpaceS

- **Location:** Spaceship
- **Unlocked by:** Alien Expedition Trail: IC Learning to Breathe
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 each Ledd and Noit
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Security Boots https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1103-police-shoes-7956-67847.png
- **Recommendations:** I LIKE me the boots, and Ledd and Noit have excellent drops. Recommend.

### Tribe Member - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** LF MQ4
- **Type:** Forum
- **Requirements:** Post 5 Messages in the Forum
- **Rewards:** 8 Core Crystals
- **Recommendation:** This is your last chance to earn Core Crystals for quite a while, and it's so easy. Go for it! Make friends! Or post in one of the nonsense threads.

### Trouble Above - PG

- **Location:** Purple Gate
- **Unlocked by:** PG MQ3/Keep Pushing Forward
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Leopar and 10 Poe
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe x2: Chain Necklace https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1204-chain-necklace-8563-71819.png and Leopar Earrings https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1201-snake-earrings-8529-18956.png
- **Recommendations:** My recommendation for most Purple Gate sidequests is pretty uniform: take the quest if you like the reward, and you can figure out the rest!

### Trying Your Patience - TT

- **Location:** Tall Trees
- **Unlocked by:** Forest Expedition Trail: FB Javelin Toss West
- **Type:** Streak
- **Requirements:** Maintain a 10-day Streak
- **Rewards:** 3 Wooden Keys
- **Recommendations:** Unless you need space in your Questbook, what's to lose by keeping this?

### Tunnel Locked On - Ruins

- **Location:** Underground Ruins
- **Desert Expedition Trail:** (open via Gansu MQ8/Dust to Dust) • Gansu Digging Into Desert Sands • DigS Question to Axe • IN ANY ORDER: [ Ruins Searching South • Ruins Navigating North • Ruins Withdrawing West • Ruins Excavating East ] • **Tunnel Locked On** • (access to Shrine of Ages)
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 3 Kapir Tufts, 3 Spider Poison, and 3 Desert Stones
- **PREREQUISITES:** Navigating North, Searching South, Withdrawing West, Excavating East quests in any order
- **Rewards:** Unlock Shrine of Ages
- **Recommendations:** Want to enter the fun house/ bizarro world of the game? Come on, you know you do! And there are some nice little rewards in here, too.

### Twisted Treacherous Trails (2/2) - SwampL

- **Location:** Swamplands
- **Raina Expedition Trail Route:** (open via Main Quest Highway Riza MQ6/Journey Upriver) • Riza Raina Surface Camp • SurfaceC Energy Now, Tired Later • SwampL Wading Through & Onwards (1/2) • **Twisted Treacherous Trails (2/2)** • SacredS A Worthy Offering
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 each:
  - Heliodae
  - Rhamp
  - Quishi
  - Tritus
  - Copei
  - Galai
  - Swamp Wignow
- **Rewards:** Unlock Raina Sacred Site, Wardrobe: Quishi Necklace https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;786-beaver-necklace-5336-27752.png
- **Recommendations:** You've got this! Think of all the lovely River things you're accruing! Once you have a safe 200-500 stash of River Grass and River Water, they become a great source of emergency Coins.

### Uncanny Swamp Wisthu - Hideout

- **Location:** Rebel Raina Hideout
- **Unlocked by:** Raina Expedition Trail: SacredS A Worthy Offering
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 6 Wisthu
- **Rewards:** 3 Stempos & Wardrobe: Black Feather Scarf https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;711-black-feather-scarf-4662-30189.png
- **Recommendations:** Fairly straightforward; just remember to keep an eye on the Pushing Back Rebels questline to avoid fighting more Wisthu than necessary.

###Untu Leaders United - ShrineNPC

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Wardrobe: Special Event NPC Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 each: 
  - Captain Shin
  - Untu Captain Uo
- **Rewards:** 25 Shrine Stones, Wardrobe x2: Captain Shin Hair https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;shin&#95;hair&#95;blue.png and Shin Earrings https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;shin&#95;earrings.png
- **Recommendations:**  This hair was the first thing I desperately wanted to spend Crystals on when I joined, and these were my first earrings, so I'm quite nostalgic for them. I also have no need for them, and that desperate feeling predates about 95% of the wardrobe options we now have. So it's hard to evaluate whether they're worth 12K battle words - you'll have to decide for yourself.

### Valley Of The Sheep - HuntS2

- **Location:** Elder Library 
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS2 No Wrong Path
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each: Attleas, Shashi, Imali
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** This is possibly the easiest way to get Hunter Tokens by battling creatures. And the sheep are so cute. Totally worth it.

###Velts' Relaxation Method  - HuntS1.2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Maikile, 1 Buholi, 1 Oncaiii, and 1 Nezthai
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  I suspect this is not all that important, but it's a nice way to make things count double!

###Velts' Strong Start  - HuntS1.2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Streak, Wordcount, Battle
- **Requirements:** Reach 10-day Streak, write 10000 words, defeat 1 Tambo
- **Rewards:** 2 Stempos and Wardrobe: Hunt Aging Eyebrows https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1529-hunt-aging-eyebrows-10437-30092.png
- **Recommendations:**  My *guess* (emphasis on "guess") is that this will be the start of another Velts chain for this season, so I'm happy to get it out of the way. Curious if my guess holds up!

### Venomous Villains - Balance

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Unlocked by:** Balance MQ1/ Help From A Master
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 7 Nuig, 7 Aracnu, 7 Ylly, and 7 Sparfly
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest and 1 River Key
- **Recommendations:** Again, for those counting at home, this is a minimum of 3 Areas in 3 Regions (Nuig available only in Balance, Ylly only in Gansu in the Desert, and Aracnu only in Luciola in the Forest; Sparfly might as well be picked up in Gansu while you're there). Which makes it pair really well with Elemental Powers, which also involves a lot of travel and Nuig. Don't forget to consider Nuig-heavy Stingy Surprise and Main Quest 3 at the same time. And while you're traveling, consider those 5 Lorsa Nests for the Scouting Lorsa quest.

### Wading Through & Onwards (1/2) - SwampL

NOTE: This exact quest was offered during the Raina Festival in April 2020; if you completed it then, it will not be available now.

- **Location:** Swamplands
- **Raina Expedition Trail Route:** (open via Main Quest Highway Riza MQ6/Journey Upriver) • Riza Raina Surface Camp • SurfaceC Energy Now, Tired Later • **Wading Through & Onwards (1/2)** • SwampL Twisted Treacherous Trails (2/2) • SacredS A Worthy Offering
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each:
  - Heliodae
  - Rhamp
  - Quishi
  - Tritus
  - Copei
  - Larida
  - Galai
  - Swamp Wignow
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Ghillie Suit Head https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;705-ghillie-suit-top-4590-12257.png, progress on questline
- **Recommendations:** Gotta get through this to get on. Good luck! (Maaaybe save Larida for last, so as to get maximum overlap between turning in this quest and picking up the next.)

### Wandering We Go - HuntS2

- **Location:** Elder Library 
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Streak
- **Requirements:** Maintain a 7-day Streak
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Pick it up and hang on to it!

### Warm Creature Highlights (1/3) - MT

Note: NOT POSSIBLE to complete till Oge-Mai Desert fully unlocked

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via LF MQ 4) • **Warm Creature Highlights 1/3** • MT Cool Creature Highlights 2/3 • MT Creature Colors & Highlights 3/3
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** 
  - Deliver:
    - 3 Red Dye
    - 5 Spider Poison
    - 5 Ardi Lamp
    - 10 Feathers
    - 10 Nezthai Claws
  - Defeat:
    - 5 Ripos
    - 3 Desert Rudakai
    - 5 Sapiti
    - 5 Tylu
- **Rewards:** 2 Bones Chests
- **Recommendations:** The quest description aptly warns you: **Advanced Quest - Must have Desert Expedition Areas unlocked to Complete**. The reward is fairly useless until you get to the Dust Region (at which point it's quite nice). So this is a late-game thing in practice, and you absolutely shouldn't bother until far later, when you know what these things are. That said, Ardi Lamps and Nezthai Claws are in Forward Base (see Travel Directions if you need help figuring out how to get there; it's in the Forest Expedition), Sapiti are in Stone City (ditto), and Ripos is in the Underground Ruins in the Desert Expedition. And if you can't figure out the rest, you probably haven't gone far enough in the game to worry about it.

### Water Tribe Member - Riza

- **Location:** Riza Rivertown
- **Unlocked by:** Gansu MQ8/Dust to Dust
- **Type:** Forum
- **Requirements:** Make 100 Forum posts
- **Rewards:** 15 Core Crystals
- **Recommendations:** DO IT. It will take approximately FOREVER. (Good news: you don't have to keep it in your Questbook. It counts all the forum posts you've ever made, no matter how many times you drop the quest while you're doing it.) Then you'll get to know everyone in the forums, which is fun! So yes, do it, but don't worry about officially picking it up except when you want to check how close you are to turning it in.

### Water Tribe Stripes - Riza

- **Location:** Riza Rivertown
- **Quest Path:** (open via Main Quest Highway Gansu MQ8/Dust to Dust) • Riza Amateur Fisherman • Riza Apprentice Fisherman • **Water Tribe Stripes** 
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 15 Patliadu
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Water Tribe War Paint
- **Recommendations:** Depends on where you are in the game, and in how much of a hurry. 15 Harpoons might be a lot right now, or they might be dirt cheap. Personally, I think the Water Tribe War Paint is worth it.

### Watering Hole - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** LF MQ4
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 44 Wignow
- **Rewards:** 4 Wooden Keys, 1 Steel Dagger
- **Recommendation:** Those Wignow are good munching, you'll get a valuable stockpile of Leaves and Essence out of it, go ahead and pick it up unless you hate Wignow.

### Watering Hole Puna - Gansu

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Quest Path:** (open via 3PC MQ5/A Way South) • **Watering Hole Puna** • Gansu: Gansu Watering Hole Puffs
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Puna
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Key
- **Recommendations:** Do it. Immediately. A Stone Key for 1500 words and 10 Wooden Fishing Rods? Cheap!

### A Way North: Up the Mountain - 3PC

- **Location:** Three Points Crossing
- **Alien Expedition Trail:** (open via 3PC MQ5/A Way South) • **A Way North: Up The Mountain** • IC Learning to Breathe • IN ANY ORDER: [SpaceS Technology & Dinti • SpaceS Orders to Repair]
- **Type:** Battle, Collection, Streak
- **Requirements:** Attain a 5-day Streak, deliver 30 Rope, defeat 30 Puna, 2 Bruja, 1 Yasri, 1 Lombri, and 1 Tambo
- **Rewards:** Unlock Impact Crater
- **Recommendations:** This is a fairly massive undertaking, but you're in the Desert: there's very little that isn't a massive undertaking. And the Alien Meteoroid area is a lot of fun, with a lot of diverse options as you get deep in it.

### We Lucky Few - 3PC

- **Location:** Three Points Crossing
- **Unlocked by:** MT MQ4
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 8 Rusty Amulet, 8 Rusty Pendant, 20 Dust
- **Rewards:** 3 Leafsung Keys
- **Recommendations:** This could get pricey, but Leafsung Keys are rare. Save it for when you're headed for the Forest anyway, and remember that Mama Tree Wooden Chests will give you Rusty Pendants AND other useful Quest goodies.

### We Wander Together - HuntS2

- **Location:** Elder Library 
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Forum
- **Requirements:** Make at least 3 posts in the Forum
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** It's basically never a mistake to take up a forum quest, in my Oh So Humble Opinion, because the forums rock. Maybe I should make a list of all Forum Quests so you can plan overlap! (There's a few in the Hunt, one in Luciola, one in Mama Tree, and one in Riza...)

### Weekly: Monster Hunter

- **Location:** Global
- **Route:** none needed; globally available from the start
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Battle 30 Monsters of any kind
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Key (used starting in the 4th region; collect all you can when you can)
- Renews approx. 150 hours after delivery

### When Tylu Portal - ShrineFools

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Fools' Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Fools' Tylu & 5 Fools' Tylu (Halloween)
- **Rewards:** 25 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** It's pretty straightforward. Tackle the Tylu, win the Shrine Stones. Good luck!

### Where Life Flows - HuntS3

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS2 Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 50 Swamp Moss
- **Rewards:** 15 Hunter Tokens & 10 Wooden Fishing Rods
- **Recommendations:** Swamp Moss is available in the deeper parts of Raina, if you have trouble finding it. And while I wouldn't belabor myself to fill this up, it's a nice use for the Swamp Moss one tends to accumulate in Raina. The Wooden Fishing Rods are GREAT!

###Which Witch Is This? - ShrineNPC

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Wardrobe: Special Event NPC Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Witch Monvoisin
- **Rewards:** 75 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:**  This is a pretty darn good Shrine Stone grinder, if you're after that.

### White Coat - Gansu

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Unlocked by:** 3PC MQ5/A Way South
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 10 White Fur
- **Rewards:** 3 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** Same as with Sacred Feathers, if you're seeing this when you first get to Gansu and wondering how you do it, Step 1 is "get to the third Main Quest in Gansu". That's what makes Suulan available. They're very reliable about dropping White Fur, so you'll need a fairly predictable 5-10 Steel Daggers and 10,000 words to beat this quest, but I'd save it till after you're done with the rest of Gansu and its various White Fur needs. (Also, be aware that coming back to this after you reach the Dust Region will give you more options for White Fur sources.)

###The Winding Path to Elder Library - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Hunt Trail Route:** (unlocked via LF MQ4/Don't Regift Curses) • **The Winding Path to Elder Library** • HuntS1 Joining the Hunt • HuntS1 The Hunt Begins • HuntS1 Deeper Forest Hunting • HuntS1 A Past Not Forgotten • HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library • HuntS2 All Who Wander • HuntS2 Oh, Endless Possibilities! • HuntS2 No Wrong Path • Hunt S2 Stumbling Upon Sheep • HuntS3 To Grow & Change • HuntS3 Bettering Ourselves • HuntS3 Bigger & Brighter • HuntS3 A Bubble Dream • HuntS4 Dirt to Dust • HuntS4 Celebrate Joy • HuntS4 Still Missing Something • HuntS4 Proving Your Friendship
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Tylu and 3 Illi
- **Rewards:** Unlock Elder Library; 100 Coins
- **Recommendations:** This is your first step into a larger world. Elder Library is the first Expedition area you can unlock - an area with quests, loot, and monsters independent of the main quests. And Elder Library hosts the Hunt for the Ancients, a perpetually-updating event with tons of fun quests and wardrobe and house items... DO THIS when you can! (And see if you can combine it with A Family Tree, if that interests you in the slightest.)

### Withdrawing West - Ruins

- **Location:** Underground Ruins
- **Desert Expedition Trail:** (open via Gansu MQ8/Dust to Dust) • Gansu Digging Into Desert Sands • DigS Question to Axe • IN ANY ORDER: [ Ruins Searching South • Ruins Navigating North • **Withdrawing West** • Ruins Excavating East ] • Ruins Tunnel Locked On • (access to Shrine of Ages)
- **Type:** Words, Battle
- **Requirements:** Write 670 words, defeat 1 Griffe
- **Rewards:** 5 Raw Sandstone
- **Recommendations:** Do it! Make sure you have the other directional quests at the same time, so you're not duplicating effort on wordcount.

### A Worthy Offering - SacredS

- **Location:** Raina Sacred Site
- **Raina Expedition Trail Route:** (open via Main Quest Highway Riza MQ6/Journey Upriver) • Riza Raina Surface Camp • SurfaceC Energy Now, Tired Later • SwampL Wading Through & Onwards (1/2) • SwampL Twisted Treacherous Trails (2/2) • **A Worthy Offering** 
- **Type:** Streak, Wordcount, Collection
- **Requirements:** Attain 10-day Streak, 10000 Words, deliver 10 Hardwood, 10 Rope, and 10 Steel Bars
- **Rewards:** Unlock Rebel Raina Hideout, Wardrobe: Golden Earrings https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;778-golden-earrings-5292-58135.png
- **Recommendations:** You'll want this one. Seeing as how it unlocks the last Raina area. Plenty of time to look around while you're waiting for those 10 days to pass.

### Wrestlin' Swamp Larida - SwampL

- **Location:** Swamplands
- **Unlocked by:** Raina Expedition Trail: SurfaceC Energy Now, Tired Later
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 15 Larida
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Larida Necklace https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;777-crocodile-necklace-5291-45454.png
- **Recommendations:** Self-evident. Either that necklace is perfect or not.

### Write, You Fool - ShrineFools

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and  Wardrobe: Fools' Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Fools' Wrimo
- **Rewards:** 15 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** ATTACK! This is made to take in a rush; Fools' Wrimo doesn't allow for much pausing.

### Written Accounts - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** LF MQ4
- **Type:** Words
- **Requirements:** Write 25,000 words
- **Rewards:** 100 Coins, 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendation:** Pick this up immediately and let it fill itself. Especially if you've just come over from finishing Luciola Forest: any words you've written the day you pick up the quest will count. (Downside: your Attack bonus doesn't affect how many words you have to write. It will be 25,000 regardless.)

### Written Accounts - 3PC

- **Location:** Three Points Crossing
- **Quest Path:** (open via MT MQ4) • **Written Accounts** • 3PC Written Accounts: Attack on 3 Points
- **Type:** Words
- **Requirements:** Write 75,000 Words (Attack Bonuses Do Not Count)
- **Rewards:** 3 Gold Bars
- **Recommendations:** Take this immediately, as with all wordcount quests. You'll automatically be working on them no matter what else you do. Free Gold!

### Written Accounts: Attack on 3 Points - 3PC

- **Location:** Three Points Crossing
- **Quest Path:** (open via MT MQ4) • 3PC Written Accounts • **Written Accounts: Attack on 3 Points** 
- **Type:** Words
- **Requirements:** Write 50,000 Words (Attack Bonuses Do Not Count)
- **Rewards:** 2 Golden Chests
- **Recommendations:** Same as with the last Written Accounts (though you will have to turn in the previous Written Accounts before this even appears as an option). What do you have to lose?

### Zappy Zazzy Xombri - RLab

- **Location:** Research Lab
- **Quest Path:** (open via Alien Expedition Trail: SpaceS Orders to Repair) • RLab Set Creatures Free! (1/4) • RLab Create a Clearing (2/4) • RLab Build a Biodome (3/4) • RLab Encourage an Ecosystem (4/4) • IN ANY ORDER [RLab Making Mellow Mowow  (*unlocks Mowow in Wilderness*)• RLab Sagacious Sincere Sabu (*unlocks Sabu in Wilderness*) • RLab Silkly Sleek Sulanica (*unlocks Sulanica in Wilderness*)• **Zappy Zazzy Xombri (*unlocks Xombri in Wilderness*)**• RLab Zooty Zanutaki Zings (*unlocks Zanutaki in Wilderness*)]
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 25 Dust, 15 Rope, 10 Desert Stones, and 3 Fur
- **Rewards:** 1 Stempo, unlock Xombri
- **Recommendations:** There are a lot of quests here that need no extra recommendations, so here's a boilerplate to say this is one of them. :)

### Zilya's Defensive Lorsa - 3PC

- **Location:** Three Points Crossing
- **Unlocked by:** MT MQ4
- **Type:** Collection 
- **Requirements:** Collect/Craft 10 Lorsa nests
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest
- **Recommendations:** You have SO MANY other uses for Wood (and Leaves, for that matter) besides building Lorsa Nests right now. Go ahead, if it makes you happy; you'll have more opportunities to build Lorsa Nests later, too. I wouldn't prioritize this.

### Zooty Zanutaki Zings - RLab

- **Location:** Research Lab
- **Quest Path:** (open via Alien Expedition Trail: SpaceS Orders to Repair) • RLab Set Creatures Free! (1/4) • RLab Create a Clearing (2/4) • RLab Build a Biodome (3/4) • RLab Encourage an Ecosystem (4/4) • IN ANY ORDER [RLab Making Mellow Mowow  (*unlocks Mowow in Wilderness*)• RLab Sagacious Sincere Sabu (*unlocks Sabu in Wilderness*) • RLab Silkly Sleek Sulanica (*unlocks Sulanica in Wilderness*)• RLab Zappy Zazzy Xombri (*unlocks Xombri in Wilderness*)• **Zooty Zanutaki Zings (*unlocks Zanutaki in Wilderness*)**]
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 15 Glass Shards, 10 Nuig String, 10 Dried Pulp, and 2 Tambo Mane
- **Rewards:** 1 Stempo, unlock Zanutaki
- **Recommendations:** Welp, you're up against Dried Pulp in this, which means you'll need to have unlocked Dark Forest Outpost to complete this. And honestly it makes sense that you need something from the Dust-haunted Dark Forest to unlock this nightmare of a creature. And so far, Zanutaki are not required for any quests. And Nuig String isn't cheap, unless you've been battling a lot in Balance for other reasons. This... is not something I'd prioritize
