LAST UPDATED 30 MAY 2020

Welcome to Pride! This year's is all out, and I'm happy to see certain wardrobe items returning (some of which I'd somehow missed previously, this is as good as the Shrine dumping all previous Prides and then adding some). Do NOT miss the news event! https://4thewords.com/forum/details-263 I'm interested in the Pride parade.

The event started on 29 May 2020 at 10 AM Costa Rica Time, for future reference. Updated 30 May when Steel the Rainbow got added.

I particularly love the Pride Parade this event: https://4thewords.com/community/parade We get to send our avatars on a Pride parade to make up for COVID-19 cancelling most in-person events.

Happy Pride, everyone!

## Quests

### Take Five, Nitana

- **Unlocked by:** Pride 2020 Opening
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Nitana and 1 Pride Nitana
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Basic Short https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;763-basic-short-5142-48372.png (8 variants in solid colors; see Wardrobe for details)
- **Recommendations:** A challenge to us mid-to-low-range writers, but a nice solid basic clothing item as a reward. Make sure you consider the All The Colors! quest simultaneously, so you get the most out of your Pride Nitana battle.

### Steel the Rainbow

- **Unlocked by:** Pride 2020 Opening
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Pride Nitana
- **Rewards:** 20 Mini Pride Flags & Wardrobe: Pride Pants https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;pride&#95;pants.png (15 variants for different Pride flags; see Wardrobe for details)
- **Recommendations:** Keep an eye on the Valley Pride Celebration! quest (and All the Colors!) to make sure you're getting the most out of your Pride Nitana battles.

### Pride's Purple Prancers

- **Unlocked by:** Pride 2020 Opening
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 15 Pride Xin
- **Rewards:** 20 Mini Pride Flags & Wardrobe: Minishirt https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;minishirt&#95;white.png (7 variants: 6 solid colors & 1 rainbow; see Wardrobe for details)
- **Recommendations:** Check out the Pride Xin and make sure you're doubling up quests as much as possible if 20 Xin sounds unpleasantly challenging. That said, the Minishirt is a very worthwhile reward, and 1500 battle words are not hard at all.

### Wignow High Five

- **Unlocked by:** Pride 2020 Opening
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Pride Wignow, 3 Wignow, and 5 Desert Wignow
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Fishnet Long Sleeved Shirt https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;754-fishnet-long-sleeved-shirt-5016-39254.png (7 variants in solid colors; see Wardrobe for details)
- **Recommendations:** If you're fairly new to the game, you may not know that **Desert Wignow are (surprise, surprise) in the Desert Region of the game** - after you finish the main quests in Luciola Forest and Mama Tree and advance to Three Points Crossing. Since this is the only quest involving monsters not found in Luciola Forest, it seemed worth mentioning. However, it's also worth mentioning that the main quests in LF and MT are totally doable within a month, if you work at it (even if you're a slower writer like me), so don't count this one out.

### Low Five Awa

- **Unlocked by:** Pride 2020 Opening
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Pride Awa & 5 Awa
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Semi Skirt https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;762-semi-skirt-5126-42726.png (8 variants in solid colors; see Wardrobe for details)
- **Recommendations:** Go ahead and make sure you have the All The Colors! quest in line as well, so you can make the most of your Pride Awa fight.

### All the Colors! (Part 1 of 2)

- **Unlocked by:** Pride 2020 Opening
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each:
  - Pride Wignow
  - Pride Awa
  - Pride Xin
  - Pride Nitana
  - Pride Sassi
- **Rewards:** 20 Mini Pride Flags & Wardrobe: Pride Shirt https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;basicshirt&#95;pride.png (15 variants for different Pride flags; see Wardrobe for details)
- **Recommendations:** Look, you want to add all these to your Bestiary anyway, right? You want those Mini Pride Flags even if you've earned the Pride Shirt in a past event. (And if you haven't earned the Pride Shirt... well. The benefits are obvious.)  Keep an eye out for other monster quests to double up with this.

### Valley Pride Celebration! (Part 2 of 2)

- **Unlocked by:** Pride Quest: All the Colors! (Part 1 of 2)
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 each:
  - Pride Wignow
  - Pride Awa
  - Pride Xin
  - Pride Nitana
  - Pride Sassi
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Pride Scarf https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;752-pride-scarf-4992-68649.png (5 variants; 1 rainbow and 4 more-or-less solid colors; see Wardrobe for details)
- **Recommendations:** It's a stretch for slower writers (if you're high-output I don't know why you're even reading my recs instead of just deciding to DO ALL THE QUESTS for any event), and I'm ambivalent on the reward myself, but the pride is worth it. Especially if I sensibly manage to dovetail it with the Fight A Lot More Than Three Monsters quests for Pride Xin and Pride Sassi.

### Seriously Proud Assistants

- **Unlocked by:** Pride 2020 Opening
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Pride Sassi
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Rainbow Lips https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;751-rainbow-lips-4980-70022.png (six variants in pink and rainbow hues; see Wardrobe for details)
- **Recommendations:** First, go to the Wardrobe Section and take a look at the gorgeous images. I didn't even realize that one of the lipsticks had a star on it until I started looking closely at the large-scale one. Second, why wouldn't you want the Mini Pride Flags and Hunter Tokens that Pride Sassi drops??? Just make sure you're budgeting your words re: All The Colors! and Valley Pride Celebration! appropriately.

Sound good? On to the wardrobe!
