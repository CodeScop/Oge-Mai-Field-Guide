# Quests

###Base Camp Clearing Duty  - HuntS1.2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** HuntS1 Quest: The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Xuso, 10 Sacer, and 5 Kaija
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  This'll help you get the Saliva Vials for the Curator quest part 2, and dovetails well with Into Forest Depths.

###Dynamic Disappearing Duo  - HuntS1.2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** HuntS1 Quest: The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 2 Rudakai and 2 Wignow
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  At the moment, I'd say the quest needs to be evaluated on aesthetic grounds, because on mercenary grounds it's useless, but it's kinda fun to beat up on the monsters that steal boots in the lore (Wignow) as well as the monsters that actually cost boots to fight (Rudakai).

###Great Library Cleanup!  - HuntS1.2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** HuntS1 Quest: The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Illi and 6 Kuay
- **Rewards:** 15 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  These are great sources of Rope and Wood, so you'll get something out of this quest other than the prize (Illi has a few quests you'll overlap with, also), but maybe wait till one or both are dropping Hunter Tokens to make this truly profitable.

###Sticky, Sweet, and Alluring  - HuntS1.2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** HuntS1 Quest: The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 15 Reenu and 5 Nitana
- **Rewards:** 15 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  For the love of the flight (convenient that this quest is released when flying monsters are dropping Hunter Tokens!) Go for it!

###Tallest of Trees  - HuntS1.2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** HuntS1 Quest: The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Buhini, 5 Buhovi and 3 Buholi
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens and Wardrobe: Hunt Earrings Sword Shield https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1588-hunt-earings-sword-shield-11798-73484.png 
- **Recommendations:**  Bear in mind that you'll need 29 Nezthai Claws to complete this, which will probably mean 20-25 Nezthai battles as well, few of which will involve other quests. On the other hand, you get those really nifty earrings (you can switch which ear gets which earring, too, although it always has to be both and they always have to be different). Make sure there aren't any Buh-beast quests you want to do at the same time!

###Velts' Relaxation Method  - HuntS1.2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Maikile, 1 Buholi, 1 Oncaiii, and 1 Nezthai
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  I suspect this is not all that important, but it's a nice way to make things count double!

###Velts' Strong Start  - HuntS1.2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Streak, Wordcount, Battle
- **Requirements:** Reach 10-day Streak, write 10000 words, defeat 1 Tambo
- **Rewards:** 2 Stempos and Wardrobe: Hunt Aging Eyebrows https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1529-hunt-aging-eyebrows-10437-30092.png
- **Recommendations:**  My *guess* (emphasis on "guess") is that this will be the start of another Velts chain for this season, so I'm happy to get it out of the way. Curious if my guess holds up!

###A Secret Plan?  - HuntS1.2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Assassins & 1 Villager
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Eyepatch https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1532-hunt-cloth-eyepatch-10480-77717.png
- **Recommendations:**  Here, I'm torn between "this feels like a throwaway quest" and "but the lore hints sound important!" I'll just settle for "hey, look, Assassins drop lots of nifty things and make sure you fight the Villager in Mama Tree, where it won't cost you!"

###Familiar Assistants Needed!  - HuntS1.2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 each Sassi, Alnu, Burocat, and Clawadin
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Aging Beard https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1526-hunt-aging-beard-10389-52135.png
- **Recommendations:**  This one REALLY feels like an optional sidequest!

###Curator's Catalog Collections 1/2  - HuntS1.2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Quest Path:** (open via Hunt Trail HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library) • **Curator's Catalog Collections** • HuntS1.2 Curator's Catalog Cache 2/2
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 3 Essence, 1 Spider Poison, 3 Lorsa Fur, 1 Tambo Mane, and 5 Claws
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  This is mostly "put excess materials to good use", in my book; a lot of these materials will have been gathered with the quests to break into the Elder Library, so hurrah to that having a use for even experienced Hunt followers! (Also: chain, so weigh the benefits of the sequels.)

###Curator's Catalog Cache 2/2  - HuntS1.2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Quest Path:** (open via Hunt Trail HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library) • HuntS1.2 Curator's Catalog Collections • **Curator's Catalog Cache 2/2**
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 5 each Nezthai Claws, Saliva Vials, Gobkey Trinkets, and Rusty Pendants
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  Huh, hadn't figured that there would be a series with these collection quests. (Note that when Part 1 came out, it wasn't labeled as such.) The Gobkey Trinkets are easy to get, and the Rusty Pendants will gradually accrue as you open chests in Mama Tree (with decent Luck); Saliva Vials are easy to farm but increasingly widely used, and Nezthai Claws are something you'll already need quite a few of to complete all the quests this round. But if that's not off-putting, go for it!

###Into Forest Depths 1/3  - HuntS1.2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Quest Path:** (open via Hunt Trail HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library) • **Into Forest Depths 1/3** • HuntS1.2 Into Forest Depths 2/3 • HuntS1.2 Into Forest Depths 3/3 
- **Type:** Collection, Battle
- **Requirements:** Deliver 2 Saliva Vials and 2 Dandeleon Flowers, and defeat 3 Kaija, 3 Xuso, 5 Ardia, 5 Ardii, and 5 Ardis
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  You won't need to focus on Saliva Vials, since they'll pop up anyway while you're battling Kaija; if you've lost track, these monsters can be found entirely within Base Camp and Forward Base (or you can skip FB and battle Ardi-beasts in Mama Tree, if you've done the FB quest unlocking them!) Note that this dovetails well with the quest Base Camp Clearing Duty, if you haven't finished it yet.

###Into Forest Depths 2/3  - HuntS1.2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Quest Path:** (open via Hunt Trail HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library) • HuntS1.2 Into Forest Depths 1/3 • **Into Forest Depths 2/3** • HuntS1.2 Into Forest Depths 3/3 
- **Type:** Collection, Battle
- **Requirements:** Deliver 5 Dinti and 1 Spider Poison; defeat 5 Reudod, 3 Oncaiii, and 1 Finoir
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Facemask https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1534-hunt-neck-guard-10523-15955.png
- **Recommendations:**  Here, we move from BC and FB to Stone City and Tall Trees. The Spider Poison will pop up when you fight Oncaiii anyway; you will get some Dinti from Finoir, but might want to fight its tiny Scofin cousins to rack up more. (Or you might have plenty from the Alien Expedition.)

###Into Forest Depths 3/3  - HuntS1.2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Quest Path:** (open via Hunt Trail HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library) • HuntS1.2 Into Forest Depths 1/3 • HuntS1.2 Into Forest Depths 2/3 • **Into Forest Depths 3/3**
- **Type:** Collection, Battle
- **Requirements:** Deliver 2 Gobkey Trinkets, 2 Dandeleon Flowers, and 2 Essence; defeat 5 Gobkey, 5 Dandeleon, and 5 Maikile
- **Rewards:** 10 Hunter Tokens and House Item: Hunt Shield Ornament https://4thewords.com/public/hideouts/hideout&#95;element&#95;322&#95;30102/variant&#95;icon&#95;1197&#95;737.png 
- **Recommendations:**  Hey, first House Item reward!!! (It can also be crafted in the Hunter Token Store if you want a more detailed look at it.) You'll definitely get all your resources during your battles, which are largely in Guardian's Lair. (I wonder if the Forward-Base-dwelling Dandeleon was originally a Guardian's-Lair-dwelling Night Dandeleon? If so, the switch was kind to users; Night Dandeleons disappear during the day, but their cousins are available 24/7.)
