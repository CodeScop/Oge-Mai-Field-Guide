# Quests

###Aid of Assistants - ShrineNPC

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Wardrobe: Special Event NPC Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 each: 
  - First Officer Yu
  - Vinstacio
  - Skuppa
- **Rewards:** 50 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:**  Hey, look, the only quest here combining different monsters featured at the same event! (Look, Shrine quests tend to be pretty self-evident in terms of recommendations, I enjoy adding trivia like this.)

###Guardian of the Shrine 3/3 - Shrine0

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Quest Path:** (open via Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On) • Shrine0 Keeper of the Shrine 1/3 • Shrine0 Helper of the Shrine 2/3 • **Guardian of the Shrine 3/3**
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Motes, deliver 25 Desert Stones and 25 River Stones
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Motes Stone Belt https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1501-merchant-stone-belt-10181-25983.png
- **Recommendations:**  This is up to you. People with long memories of when the Shrine was first introduced might wonder whether this belt has any special properties - poking around, I've found none (though I've only done a cursory check).  Do remember that River Stones are both easier to get and more in demand to spend late in the Water Region, especially the Raina Expedition, so possibly avoid doing this quest until you've evaluated how that part of the game affects your choices here.

###Helper of the Shrine 2/3 - Shrine0

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Quest Path:** (open via Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On) • Shrine0 Keeper of the Shrine 1/3 • **Helper of the Shrine 2/3** • Shrine0 Guardian of the Shrine 3/3
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 2 Motes, deliver 15 Desert Stones
- **Rewards:** 2 Shrine Tickets
- **Recommendations:** The last quest had the easiest Shrine Ticket left; this has the easiest two left after that. Fully worth it, in my book. (Even if Desert Stones are pretty in demand in Desert things, at least this is only 15.)

###Keeper of the Shrine 1/3 - Shrine0

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Quest Path:** (open via Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On) • **Keeper of the Shrine 1/3** • Shrine0 Helper of the Shrine 2/3 • Shrine0 Guardian of the Shrine 3/3
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Motes
- **Rewards:** 1 Shrine Ticket
- **Recommendations:**  This is the easiest Shrine Ticket left in the game by the time you get here. Are you telling me you don't want Shrine Tickets?

###NPC's Here to Help - ShrineNPC

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Wardrobe: Special Event NPC Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each: 
  - Untu Captain Uo
  - Captain Shin
  - First Officer Yu
  - Uurwall Uzgot
  - Vinstacio
  - Skuppa
  - Witch Monvoisin
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Uurwall's Carnival Pants https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1577-uurwall-joker-pants-11156-37903.png
- **Recommendations:**  Look, you didn't buy that Bracelet to NOT fight all the monsters here and add them to your Bestiary. You know you didn't. Go ahead and get them! And get a new pair of pants while you're at it!

###Untu Leaders United - ShrineNPC

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Wardrobe: Special Event NPC Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 each: 
  - Captain Shin
  - Untu Captain Uo
- **Rewards:** 25 Shrine Stones, Wardrobe x2: Captain Shin Hair https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;shin&#95;hair&#95;blue.png and Shin Earrings https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;shin&#95;earrings.png
- **Recommendations:**  This hair was the first thing I desperately wanted to spend Crystals on when I joined, and these were my first earrings, so I'm quite nostalgic for them. I also have no need for them, and that desperate feeling predates about 95% of the wardrobe options we now have. So it's hard to evaluate whether they're worth 12K battle words - you'll have to decide for yourself.

###Which Witch Is This? - ShrineNPC

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Wardrobe: Special Event NPC Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Witch Monvoisin
- **Rewards:** 75 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:**  This is a pretty darn good Shrine Stone grinder, if you're after that.
