# New Quests - Unlocking New Expedition Areas

### A Way North: Up the Mountain

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 5/A Way South
- **Type:** Battle, Collection, Streak
- **Requirements:** Attain a 5-day Streak, deliver 30 Rope, defeat 30 Puna, 2 Bruja, 1 Yasri, 1 Lombri, and 1 Tambo
- **Rewards:** Unlock Impact Crater
- **Recommendations:** This is a fairly massive undertaking, but you're in the Desert: there's very little that isn't a massive undertaking. And the Alien Meteoroid area is a lot of fun, with a lot of diverse options as you get deep in it.

### Raina Surface Camp

- **Location:** Riza Rivertown
- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Yala and 5 Vota
- **Rewards:** Unlock Raina Surface Camp
- **Recommendations:** Do it! This area is a lot of fun, and a lot of water resources are marginally easier to grind in the Raina Expedition.

# New Quests - Base Camp

### One Hundred Creatures

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Base Camp
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 100 monsters of any kind
- **Rewards:** 5 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** Always good to have running in the background. It'll fill up without you having to pay any attention, and Stempos are nice to have.

### Just a Mean Green

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Base Camp
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 25 Xuso
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Xuso Necklace https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;974-xuso-necklace-7085-57599.png
- **Recommendations:** There seems to be a new theme of a necklace in each Expedition area, and I heartily approve. Xuso drop a lot of good basics, too.

# New Quests - Forward Base

### Lovely Flower Crown

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Forward Base
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 15 Dandeleon Flowers & 10 Saliva Vials
- **Rewards:** 3 Wooden Chests & 3 Wooden Keys
- **Recommendations:** I would leave this one for a while personally - Saliva Vials are much more useful to hoard until you've cleaned out Stone City, and Dandeleon Flowers will tend to build up in the background no matter what you're doing. But odds are that by the time you're doing a second pass of the Forest Expedition, this will be an easy win.

### To Collect Memories

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Forward Base
- **Type:** Wordcount, Streak
- **Requirements:** Write 10000 words, attain 10-day Streak
- **Rewards:** 5 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** 5 Stempos are not to be sneezed at, and the wordcount part takes care of itself. 

# New Quests - Stone City

### Slowest Tortoise Wins

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Stone City
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 12 Reudod
- **Rewards:** 2 Wooden Chests & 2 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** A very nice reward, but I admit I'm partial to these tortoises and I like an excuse to fight them.

### Sleepless in Stone City

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Stone City
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 8 Sapilo & 8 Oncaiii
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Sapiemon Necklace https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;979-monkey-necklace-7096-75774.png
- **Recommendations:** It's a little pricey, once you factor in the invisible Kaija costs, but it is a lovely necklace and they are fun beasties to battle.

### Stone City Chaos

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Stone City
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 each Sapilo, Sapira, Sapiti, and Reudod
- **Rewards:** 4 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** I hope you're looking for overlap, because this quest overlaps with pretty much every other quest in Stone City. If you haven't gotten far in the Desert yet, the Stempos are irresistibly available here. Look! Ways to pause your streak!

# New Quests - Tall Trees

### Swing, Sway, Summon

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Tall Trees
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 25 Feathers
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest, 1 Wooden Key
- **Recommendations:** I would pick this up when you have 25 Feathers to spare. (And by this point, you'll be able to guess when you have 25 Feathers to spare.) I would not put myself out grinding Feathers at this point.

### Buholi in the Sky

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Tall Trees
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Buholi
- **Rewards:** 4 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** Notice that the requirements don't mention that you'll need to fight 2-3 Nezthai for every Buholi you want to beat. 

# New Quest - Guardian's Lair

### Eat the Leaves?

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Guardian's Lair
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Maikile & 10 Wignow
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Leaf Necklace https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1010-leaf-necklace-7448-12835.png
- **Recommendations:** As this quest unlocks, I'm a long, long way past my first time in the Forest. And this quest makes me nostalgic for that time. So I'm biased in its favor. Objectively, it's worth as much as you like that Leaf Necklace (and multitasking on Wignow quests, if you have any left).

# New Quests - Dig Site

### Birbs of a Feather

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Dig Site
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 15 Rif
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest
- **Recommendations:** STONE CHEST. DO. (Just bear in mind that it pairs well with an Underground Ruins quest, so you might want to be in Ruins first.)

### Bounding Over Dunes

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Dig Site
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 6 Bevrex
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest & 1 Stone Key
- **Recommendations:** WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME. 1800 words for a Stone Chest AND a Stone Key? DOOO IT. (Possibly alongside another quest in Ruins. You'll see.)

### A Squirming Nest

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Dig Site
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 100 Loi
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Lombri Hat https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1033-lombri-hat-7567-63630.png
- **Recommendations:** Well, it's not a priority for me because I prefer shorter to-do lists even if they're large chunks, but it would be nice to just set Loi on an infinity loop for a while and see how much of this gets knocked out.

### Khaki Twisting Beige

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Dig Site
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Sakish & 3 Okkorhi
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest & 1 Stone Key
- **Recommendations:** It's nice to have a use for Sakish and Okkorhi, and it's nice to have a source for Stone Chests and Keys. Nice all around.

### Dazzling Desert Colors

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Dig Site
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Zera, 1 Suulan, and 1 Arenica
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Zera Fur Necklace https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1123-zera-fur-necklace-8039-94110.png
- **Recommendations:** I find that necklace pretty irresistible, but YMMV. I also have a weakness for battling the pretty creatures.

# New Quests - Underground Ruins

### Gordi & Griffe Gather

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Underground Ruins
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 25 Gordi & 5 Griffe
- **Rewards:** 5 Stone Blocks, 5 Sandstone Blocks, 3 Raw Gold
- **Recommendations:** I have a sneaking suspicion those rewards will look a lot more generous when we have houses. Meanwhile, it's up to you if it's worth it!

### Full of Surprises!

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Underground Ruins
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Ripos
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest & 1 Stone Key
- **Recommendations:** I'm just not into turning down those Stone Chests and Stone Keys. And Ripos *are* a source of valuable Spider Poison and Desert Stones, even if not the best source.

### Feathers & Fur

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Underground Ruins
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Bevrex and 5 Rif
- **Rewards:** 3 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** Did you wait on the Birbs of a Feather and Bounding Over Dunes in Dig Site? Because if you have this in you Questbook, it'll automatically finish while you do the other two. If not, it's still a fairly easy way to get 3 Stempos.

### Every Tunnel Connects

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Underground Ruins
- **Type:** Streak
- **Requirements:** Get a 10-day Streak
- **Rewards:** 4 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** I'm getting this for the easy Stempos. And the suspicion that this might unlock something else later...

- **Early Aug 2020 Sources Outside the Hunt:**

  August 2020 sources are Hunt monsters and monsters with wings/flight. **NOTE FOR DOUBLE TOKEN WEEK:** **Some of these do not double.** I suspect that fractional math is involved for some that are already generous without being doubled. So far, Spirit Wignow, Spirit Castu, and Ardia are the undoubled ones. Also, Buholi in Tall Trees is being weird as of this writing.
