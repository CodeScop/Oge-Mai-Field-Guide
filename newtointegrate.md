# New Quests - Dig Site

### Birbs of a Feather

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Dig Site
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 15 Rif
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest
- **Recommendations:** STONE CHEST. DO. (Just bear in mind that it pairs well with an Underground Ruins quest, so you might want to be in Ruins first.)

### Bounding Over Dunes

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Dig Site
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 6 Bevrex
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest & 1 Stone Key
- **Recommendations:** WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME. 1800 words for a Stone Chest AND a Stone Key? DOOO IT. (Possibly alongside another quest in Ruins. You'll see.)

### A Squirming Nest

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Dig Site
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 100 Loi
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Lombri Hat https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm_1033-lombri-hat-7567-63630.png
- **Recommendations:** Well, it's not a priority for me because I prefer shorter to-do lists even if they're large chunks, but it would be nice to just set Loi on an infinity loop for a while and see how much of this gets knocked out.

### Khaki Twisting Beige

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Dig Site
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Sakish & 3 Okkorhi
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest & 1 Stone Key
- **Recommendations:** It's nice to have a use for Sakish and Okkorhi, and it's nice to have a source for Stone Chests and Keys. Nice all around.

### Dazzling Desert Colors

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Dig Site
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Zera, 1 Suulan, and 1 Arenica
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Zera Fur Necklace https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf_1123-zera-fur-necklace-8039-94110.png
- **Recommendations:** I find that necklace pretty irresistible, but YMMV. I also have a weakness for battling the pretty creatures.

# New Quests - Underground Ruins

### Gordi & Griffe Gather

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Underground Ruins
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 25 Gordi & 5 Griffe
- **Rewards:** 5 Stone Blocks, 5 Sandstone Blocks, 3 Raw Gold
- **Recommendations:** I have a sneaking suspicion those rewards will look a lot more generous when we have houses. Meanwhile, it's up to you if it's worth it!

### Full of Surprises!

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Underground Ruins
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Ripos
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest & 1 Stone Key
- **Recommendations:** I'm just not into turning down those Stone Chests and Stone Keys. And Ripos *are* a source of valuable Spider Poison and Desert Stones, even if not the best source.

### Feathers & Fur

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Underground Ruins
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Bevrex and 5 Rif
- **Rewards:** 3 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** Did you wait on the Birbs of a Feather and Bounding Over Dunes in Dig Site? Because if you have this in you Questbook, it'll automatically finish while you do the other two. If not, it's still a fairly easy way to get 3 Stempos.

### Every Tunnel Connects

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Underground Ruins
- **Type:** Streak
- **Requirements:** Get a 10-day Streak
- **Rewards:** 4 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** I'm getting this for the easy Stempos. And the suspicion that this might unlock something else later...

- **Early Aug 2020 Sources Outside the Hunt:**

  August 2020 sources are Hunt monsters and monsters with wings/flight. **NOTE FOR DOUBLE TOKEN WEEK:** **Some of these do not double.** I suspect that fractional math is involved for some that are already generous without being doubled. So far, Spirit Wignow, Spirit Castu, and Ardia are the undoubled ones. Also, Buholi in Tall Trees is being weird as of this writing.
