###The Winding Path to Elder Library - MT

- **Type:** Battle

- **Recommendations:** This is your first step into a larger world. Elder Library is the first Expedition area you can unlock - an area with quests, loot, and monsters independent of the main quests. And Elder Library hosts the Hunt for the Ancients, a perpetually-updating event with tons of fun quests and wardrobe and house items... DO THIS when you can! (And see if you can combine it with A Family Tree, if that interests you in the slightest.)

**Jan 2021 Sources Outside the Hunt:**

For January, the clue is an image in the news announcement: https://4thewords.com/forum/details-325 The image looks like a torn rectangle of creamy parchment with a dark red color painted over most of it, and a much darker reddish-brown cursive capital L. The consensus is that this means red monsters, and monsters with names starting with L - which is a solid rule of thumb for the monsters below, but not entirely reliable.
