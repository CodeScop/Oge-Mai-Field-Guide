- **Early Aug 2020 Sources Outside the Hunt:**

  August 2020 sources are Hunt monsters and monsters with wings/flight. **NOTE FOR DOUBLE TOKEN WEEK:** **Some of these do not double.** I suspect that fractional math is involved for some that are already generous without being doubled. So far, Spirit Wignow, Spirit Castu, and Ardia are the undoubled ones. Also, Buholi in Tall Trees is being weird as of this writing.
