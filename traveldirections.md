LAST UPDATED 15 DEC 2020

So! The game has just updated with the Expedition bonus sections. And lovely as they are, it's changed the game from a more-or-less predetermined Main Quest track to a multiple pathway system.

So sad if someone is on the wrong branch of the path.

**This is only for people who are willing to be spoiled about number of Main Quests/chains of Expedition Quests/chains of Hunt Quests.** If not, happy hunting! It's fun to explore!

So I'm going to try to give directions to people who want to know how to get to things requiring unlocking quests in multiple directions. 

First, an outline of the game:

**There are four overarching regions: Forest Region, Desert Region, Water Region, and Dust Region.** Traveling between Regions takes time or Coins, so it's nice to plan so that you can stay in one region as much as possible.

**The regions are divided into areas,** subsections that unlock as you progress through the game.

**The areas are grouped into two kinds: Oge-Mai and Expedition.** Oge-Mai areas contain the Main Quests and driving plot of the game; Expedition is designed to be a playground and area to explore for the fun of it. Each Main Quest gets you farther down a main road of the game; each side quest (and all Expedition quests are technically sidequests) gets you closer to a dead end, although often a scenic and profitable dead end.

**The Hunt for the Ancients distributes quests in Luciola Forest, but completing them requires ranging all over the game.** The Hunt progresses through multiple "Seasons" based on completing a few crucial Hunt quests.

So, the basics:

# Oge-Mai

### Forest Region: Luciola Forest

... complete 4 Main Quests to unlock ...

### Forest Region: Mama Tree

... complete 4 Main Quests to unlock ..

### Desert Region: Three Points Crossing

... complete 5 Main Quests to unlock ...

### Desert Region: Gansu Watering Hole

... complete 8 Main Quests to unlock...

### Water Region: Riza Rivertown

... complete 6 Main Quests to unlock...

### Water Region: Floating City of Balance

... complete 5 Main Quests to unlock...

### Dust Region: Dark Forest Outpost

.... complete 12 Main Quests to unlock ???

# Expedition

The Expedition region currently has 4 entrances, one unlocking at the end of each Oge-Mai Area starting with Mama Tree and ending at Riza Rivertown. (For now.)

**A Quick Summary before we get to directions:**

The **Forest Region of Expedition** can be accessed via **Mama Tree in Oge-Mai** once all its Main Quests are done. The Forest Expedition includes the following areas:

- Base Camp
- Forward Base
- Guardian's Lair
- Stone City
- Tall Trees

The **Alien Expedition** can be accessed via **Three Points Crossing** once all its Main Quests are done. The Alien Expedition includes the following areas:

- Impact Crater
- Spaceship
- Mining Site
- Research Lab

The **Desert Expedition** can be accessed via **Gansu Watering Hole** once all its Main Quests are done. The Desert Expedition includes the following areas:

- Dig Site
- [Underground] Ruins
- Shrine of Ages (which can effectively transform into a multitude of different mini-areas depending on which passes you buy with Shrine Tickets)

The **Raina Expedition** can be accessed via **Riza Rivertown** once all its main quests are done. The Raina Expedition includes the following areas:

- [Raina] Surface Camp
- Swamplands
- [Raina] Sacred Site
- [Rebel Raina] Hideout

So! How do we progress through these regions? Let's start in Oge-Mai in the Forest.

### Path Through Forest Expedition

1. In **Mama Tree** in Oge-Mai, finish the Main Quests. You will then be able to take the **New Adventurous Horizons** quest. This will unlock **Base Camp**. You can now travel to it on the game map.
2. You're at **Base Camp**! If that's good, stick around. If you want to go elsewhere, take the **Hard Day's Walk** quest to unlock **Forward Base**. Travel there.
3. You're at **Forward Base**! If that's good, stick around. If you want to go elsewhere, take & complete the **Feeding the Lighthouse** quest to unlock the next step.
4. You still can't get past **Forward Base**, because that just unlocked the quests that actually unlock the next areas.
   - If you want to go to **Guardian's Lair**, take and complete the **North: Homeward Bound** quest. That should unlock your path.
   - If you want to go to **Stone City**, take and complete the **Stone's Throw East** quest.
   - If you want to go to **Tall Trees**, take and complete the **Javelin Toss West** quest.

Tada! That's all the Forest Expedition.

### Path Through Alien Expedition

1. In **Three Points Crossing** in Oge-Mai, complete all Main Quests so you can then take the **A Way North: Up the Mountain** quest. This will unlock **Impact Crater** when you finish it. Go ahead and travel there.
2. You're in **Impact Crater**! Stay if you like, or complete **Learning to Breathe** to unlock the **Spaceship** area. And continue on...
3. In the **Spaceship**, as in Forward Base, you have multiple options to continue.
   - If you want to go to **Mining Site**, the smaller and more self-contained site, complete **Technology and Dinti**.
   - If you want to go to **Research Lab**, the larger and more broad-ranging site, complete **Orders to Repair**.

Congrats! That unlocks all the areas. Research Lab will challenge you to more to unlock all the content, though....

### Path Through Desert Expedition

1. In **Gansu Watering Hole** in Oge-Mai, complete all Main Quests so you can then take the **Digging Into Desert Sands** quest. This will unlock **Dig Site** when you finish it. Go ahead and travel there.
2. You're in **Dig Site**! If that's where you want to be, great. If you want to continue, take & complete the **Question to Axe** quest to unlock **Ruins**. Go ahead down.
3. You're in **Ruins**! If that's where you want to be, great. If you want to continue, go ahead and complete **Excavating East**, **Navigating North**, **Searching South**, and **Withdrawing West**: all prerequisites to take the **Tunnel Locked On** quest to unlock the **Shrine of Ages**.
6. Once you're done, you're ready to travel to **Shrine of Ages**, which is almost in a region unto itself, and plays tricks of all kinds.

### Path Through Raina Expedition

1. In **Riza Rivertown** in Oge-Mai, complete all Main Quests so you can then take the **Raina Surface Camp Quest**. This will unlock **Raina Surface Camp** when you finish it. 
2. You're in **Raina Surface Camp**! If you want to go deeper, **Energy Now, Tired Later** will unlock **Swamplands**.
3. Having made it to the **Swamplands**, you're in for a bit of a slog; you will need to complete both **Wading Through and Onwards (1/2)** and **Twisted Treacherous Trails (2/2)** to continue on to the **Raina Sacred Site**. They guard it carefully.
4. Once you're in **Raina Sacred Site**, you'll have plenty to occupy you; **A Worthy Offering** is the only way you'll be able to continue on to the **Rebel Raina Hideout**.

That's Raina!

# Hunt for the Ancients

To unlock the Hunt for the Ancients, you must take and complete the quest **Joining the Hunt** in Luciola Forest (in the **Hunt for the Ancients Quests** section of town).

Once you've completed that, you'll have a wealth of Hunt quests open to you in that same section.

To unlock more of the Hunt, you must complete a series of quests that **require Hunt Map Pieces**. These quests unlock each other in a series.

To **get the Hunt Map Pieces**, you must complete another series of quests which unlock each other in a series.

... It's usually easiest to focus on one Hunt Map Piece at a time, but if you're waiting out a streak quest on the require side, you might start working your way through the Hunt-Map-Piece giving series to get ahead.

## Progression Path through the Hunt

**Joining the Hunt** unlocks the Hunt.

### Season 1 - based in the Forest Region

**A Clue to the Past** gives the first Hunt Map Piece and **The Hunt Begins** uses it.

**Elder Library Assistants** gives Hunt Map Piece 2 and **Deeper Forest Hunting** uses it.

**Elder Library's Security** gives Hunt Map Piece 3 and **A Past Not Forgotten** uses it.

A Past Not Forgotten unlocks the Curator and the capstone quest: **The Curator of Elder Library**, which unlocks Season 2.

###Season 2 - based in the Desert Region

Quests are still obtained in Luciola Forest, but the monsters and goals are primarily in the Desert.

**Guarding the Path** gives Hunt Map Piece 4 and **All Who Wander** uses it.

**State of Rest** gives Hunt Map Piece 5 and **Oh, Endless Possibilities!** uses it.

**A Distant Figure** gives Hunt Map Piece 6 and **No Wrong Path** uses it.

No Wrong Path unlocks the Shepherd and the capstone quest: **Stumbling Upon Sheep**, which unlocks Season 3.

###Season 3 - based in the Water Region

Quests are still obtained in Luciola Forest, but the monsters and goals are primarily in the Water. **Note that all the Hunt Map Piece-providing quests may be picked up simultaneously.**

**Moving Flora** gives Hunt Map Piece 7 and **To Grow & Change** uses it.

**Flying Past Sparks** gives Hunt Map Piece 8 and **Bettering Ourselves** uses it.

**Insight Grows** gives Hunt Map Piece 9 and **Bigger & Brighter** uses it.

Bigger and Brighter unlocks the Caretaker (in Dark Forest Outpost) and the capstone quest: **A Bubble Dream**, which unlocks Season 4.

### Season 4 - based all over

The side quests for Season 4 do focus on the Dust Region, but the main part of this one goes everywhere else instead. **Once again, Hunt Map Piece-providing quests may be picked up simultaneously.**

**Something Extraordinary** gives Hunt Map Piece 10 and **Dirt to Dust** uses it.

**Ideas Brought to Life** gives Hunt Map Piece 11 and **Celebrate Joy** uses it.

And then along comes **Still Missing Something** which takes away ALL the Hunt Map Pieces so far and lets you unlock **Proving Your Friendship**, which appears to be the capstone of Year 1 of the Hunt (writing this in December 2020; who knows what will happen when the next year of the Hunt unlocks on 24 Jan 2021???)
