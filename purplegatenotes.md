# Purple Gate

These were all my rough notes. I'm slowly stripping them down to the pure Questline Summary as I transfer information to the Guide draft of [quests](https://github.com/CodeScop/Oge-Mai-Field-Guide/blob/master/purplegatequests.md), [monsters](https://github.com/CodeScop/Oge-Mai-Field-Guide/blob/master/purplegatemonsters.md), and [resources](https://github.com/CodeScop/Oge-Mai-Field-Guide/blob/master/purplegateresources.md) for the Purple Gate (and, eventually, for other surprises unlocked along with this stuff).

Most of the Purple Gate stuff has been transferred to the Guide. There are notes for a certain part of the release that are being tracked [here](https://github.com/CodeScop/Oge-Mai-Field-Guide/blob/master/cavenotes.md), if you want more spoilers than the Guide has.
