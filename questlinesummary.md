LAST UPDATED 7 SEPT 2020

Note: This is just a quick list/summary. See the relevant region summary Sidequest list for full details.

The **bolded bullet points** are supposed to mainly be the **Main Quests**. (The formatting laughs at me occasionally.) If something is indented inside that, it means it's unlocked by completing the Main Quest it's indented under. Further indentations mean a chain of quests successively unlocking each other.

I do cheat and also use bolded bullet points to mark the "path" to progress in areas like Expedition and the Hunt.

(Other quests are not the only things unlocked by certain questlines, so parantheticals might mention newly-craftable items or newly-unlocked areas.)
