LAST UPDATED 24 MAY 2020

Note: This is just a quick list/summary. See the relevant region summary Sidequest list for full details.

The **bolded bullet points** are supposed to mainly be the **Main Quests**. (The formatting laughs at me occasionally.) If something is indented inside that, it means it's unlocked by completing the Main Quest it's indented under. Further indentations mean a chain of quests successively unlocking each other.

(Other quests are not the only things unlocked by certain questlines, so parantheticals might mention newly-craftable items or newly-unlocked areas.)
