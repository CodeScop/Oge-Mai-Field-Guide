## Mama Tree Main Quests

### Main Quest 1: To Great Heights

- **Type:** Battle & Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Lorsa and craft 1 Lorsa Nest
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendations:** Lorsa are nice and straightforward. The Lorsa Nest probably won't take long to scrounge for: you'll need 6 Leaves, 2 Claws, 10 Wood, and 5 Rope, which you can get from fighting a Tylu (2-3 Claws and 1 Leaf), 3 Awas (6 Rope and around 5 Leaves and 4 Wood), and 4 Xin (around 7 Wood, plus extra Leaves), which is about 1600 words. Lorsa are also a nice source of Feathers if you want to go back to the LF Safety Hats quest.

### Main Quest 2: A Secret Message

- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 3 Essence, 5 Feathers, and 8 Dust
- **Rewards:** 1 Steel Dagger
- **Recommendations:** Between Lorsa and Wignow, you should be able to cover this easily even if your previous supplies aren't up to scratch. Remember that Wignow will help with the Watering Hole sidequest, too, if you picked that up. This conflicts with the Shaman's Hideout sidequest in that they have a lot of requirements in common, but still nice to do both.

### Main Quest 3: Elder Library

- **Type:** Battle 
- **Requirements:** Defeat the Search Party
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendations:** Search Party appears as a monster in the Wilderness during the span of this quest, and only during the span of this quest. And no, it doesn't drop anything. Just go ahead and power through when you feel up to it.

### Main Quest 4: Aid to an Elder

- **Type:** Battle 
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Assassins
- **Rewards:** Suw√∂ as Companion, Three Points Crossing unlocks, Stone of the Forest
- **Recommendations:** Up your Luck before fighting Assassins, and they're more likely to give you Wooden Keys and Steel Daggers. Also, stick around and work on some sidequests after this, because Three Points Crossing can be demanding and it's nice to be stocked up first.
