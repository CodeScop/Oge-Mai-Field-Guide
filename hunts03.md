LAST UPDATED 10 FEB 2021

Season 2 is back in the Desert; now, we're in the Water Region, to Season 3: The Season of Growth, watched over by the Caretaker.

## Season 3 Quests - The Main Line

This is a tad different from previous Seasons, in that the Hunt Map Piece comes from sources *other* than Assistant-battling-quests, but otherwise it's similar: gather the Hunt Map Pieces in quests, and complete the forward progression by completing the quests that require those Hunt Map Pieces.

### Moving Flora

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Streak
- **Requirements:** Reach 5 Streak days in a row
- **Rewards:** Hunt Map Piece 7, 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Pick up, hang on, beat out! We're in the rhythm now, and ready to keep going!

### To Grow & Change

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Collection, Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 of any monster, collect Hunt Map Piece 7
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Facepaint Side https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;667-hunt-facepaint-side-4049-28215.png
- **Recommendations:** Make sure you've got the Moving Flora quest, and this will mostly handle itself!

### Flying Past Sparks

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Nuig
- **Rewards:** Hunt Map Piece 8, 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** The Season of Growth seems to be favoring us with a gentler way to obtain Hunt Map Pieces so far - we do NOT need to complete Moving Flora to unlock this quest. Still, we do need to complete this one to continue on the Hunt Map Pieces chain, so let's dig in.

### Bettering Ourselves

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: To Grow & Change
- **Type:** Collection, Streak
- **Requirements:** Collect Hunt Map Piece 8 & reach a 5-day Streak
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Complex Brooch https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;651-hunt-complex-brooch-3813-44800.png
- **Recommendations:** The Season of Growth is certainly encouraging us to build our Streaks!

### Insight Grows

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 20 Puna
- **Rewards:** 15 Hunter Tokens & Hunt Map Piece 9
- **Recommendations:** The trend continues! Once again, the quest to get Hunt Map Piece 9 does not depend on the quest to get Hunt Map Piece 8. (One of my test accounts is in the interesting position of possessing Hunt Map Piece 9 and not 8.) Still, you'll need this to keep the main Hunt line going, so I suppose it's worth the Puna. (There are approximately 423,293,478 Puna quests in the game, and after completing all of them, I'm rather tired of the fishies. For those who have not completed them, I recommend checking out what quests overlap, especially in Balance.)

### Bigger and Brighter

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: Bettering Ourselves
- **Type:** Collection, Streak
- **Requirements:** Collect Hunt Map Piece 9 & reach a 5-day Streak
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Facepaint Trident https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;665-hunt-facepaint-trident-4021-27616.png
- **Recommendations:** Still streaking! (Sorry, couldn't resist.) And as of this writing, still waiting to see what gets unlocked next by this one! But the Caretaker will almost certainly require this quest to unlock.

### A Bubble Dream

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: Bigger and Brighter
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Caretaker
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Cactus Sprite Pet https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;861-cactus-sprite-pet-6003-60430.png
- **Recommendations:** This is part of the trail to get through the Hunt. Note that the Caretaker is in Dark Forest Outpost...

## Season 3 Quests - Growing Sideline

NOTE: As of this writing (25 Jul 2020), several of these are entitled "Growing (X)" in Town, and "Proving (X)" when you pick it up. I'm sticking with "Growing" here because it seems to be the intended version.

### Growing Improvement

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Jaihri
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Check out the list of quests Jaihri have to their name - there's quite a few! This will dovetail with a lot of quests in the regular game.

### Growing Your Perception 2/3

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: Growing Improvement
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Castu, 3 Isartu, and 1 Water Rudakai
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** A lot here rides on how much you like the monsters, and how much you like the rewards. You'll probably want to see whether, as in previous Seasons, this questline culminates in a fifth quest with a nifty wardrobe reward. (I'm writing this just as this quest released and the chain is only three quests long; hopefully I remember to update when the answer drops next month.) In the meantime, you may want to keep up just to save time later, or you may want to take your time.

### Growing Your Tenacity 3/3

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: Growing Your Perception 2/3
- **Type:** Battle 
- **Requirements:** Defeat 2 Xyplos
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Same as the previous quest: depends whether it appeals and whether you like the prospect of the end of the questline.

### Growing Your Valor 4/4

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: Growing Your Tenacity 3/3
- **Type:** Battle 
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Wyvern
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Fur Ankle Boots https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;Boots&#95;Ankle&#95;Fur&#95;Black.png
- **Recommendations:** I'm personally quite fond of Wyverns, so for me this is a no-brainer. Given that it's unlocked. I don't think I'd rush through the "Growing" line for this.

## Season 3 Quests - Miscellaneous

### Helping Those In Need Grow

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver:
  - 10 Rusty Amulets
  - 5 Rusty Pendants
  - 1 Gold Bar
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Unless you have 10 Rusty Amulets just lying around, I wouldn't hurry on this. (Ditto on Rusty Pendants and Gold, but you're more likely to actually have them lying around.) The Hunter Tokens just aren't worth as much in and of themselves. Still, fun little thing to do!

### Growth Pains

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat:
  - 3 Osaril
  - 2 Trainees
  - 1 Furoxi
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** This can dovetail with a few Riza Rivertown quests, but otherwise, no hurries. Take at your own pace.

### Problems Feed Solutions

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 20 Caricaco
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Check out other Caricaco quests in Balance before completing this. There's a reason the info for this quest references "Tambo Snacks". "River Walkers" is also worth doubling up with this.

### Of Vibrant Growth

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Wordcount
- **Requirements:** Write 10K Words
- **Rewards:** 15 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** I will always recommend wordcount quests, because they will always fill themselves without you having to think about it. Win/win.

### Change To See

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Yala
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** ... you'll complete this anyway if you complete Growth in Friendship, so it overlaps well. If you can't do Growth in Friendship because you haven't unlocked Raina, this is a nice consolation prize.

### Growth in Friendship

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each: Rea & Pira, Yala, Knusha, Vota, Vaktra, Droxa, Begala
- **Rewards:** 50 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** This pairs really well with at least one Surface Camp quest, so keep an eye out for that. Just.... don't fight any of these monsters in Riza, because you'll be paying more Resources than you would fighting them in Raina.

### Where Life Flows

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 50 Swamp Moss
- **Rewards:** 15 Hunter Tokens and 10 Wooden Fishing Rods
- **Recommendations:** Swamp Moss is available in the deeper parts of Raina, if you have trouble finding it. And while I wouldn't belabor myself to fill this up, it's a nice use for the Swamp Moss one tends to accumulate in Raina. The Wooden Fishing Rods are GREAT!

## Season 3 Monsters

Season 3 is scarce on Assistants and seems to be scarce on new monsters. Seems. Is it a coincidence that Vanstra was introduced to Mama Tree along with the first month of Season 3? That Vanspi was introduced to 3PC along with the second month? Or that Vanvri was introduced in Balance along with the third month? Hmm. Still, with no evidence of connection to the Hunt apart from them dropping Hunter Tokens, I'll have to count those as non-Hunt creatures and say that Season 3 produced only two.

- **Jan 2021 Sources Outside the Hunt:**

  For January, the clue is an image in the news announcement: https://4thewords.com/forum/details-325 The image looks like a torn rectangle of creamy parchment with a dark red color painted over most of it, and a much darker reddish-brown cursive capital L. The consensus is that this means red monsters, and monsters with names starting with L - which is a solid rule of thumb for the monsters below, but not entirely reliable.
