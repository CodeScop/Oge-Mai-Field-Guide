LAST UPDATED 26 JUN 2020

Season 2 is back in the Desert; now, we're in the Water Region, to Season 3: The Season of Growth, watched over by the Caretaker.

We're starting with simple quests, because there's only 5 right now...

## Season 3 Quests

### Moving Flora

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Streak
- **Requirements:** Reach 5 Streak days in a row
- **Rewards:** Hunt Map Piece 7, 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Pick up, hang on, beat out! We're in the rhythm now, and ready to keep going!

### To Grow & Change

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Collection, Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 of any monster, collect Hunt Map Piece 7
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Facepaint Side https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;667-hunt-facepaint-side-4049-28215.png
- **Recommendations:** Make sure you've got the Moving Flora quest, and this will mostly handle themselves!

### Helping Those In Need Grow

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver:
  - 10 Rusty Amulets
  - 5 Rusty Pendants
  - 1 Gold Bar
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Unless you have 10 Rusty Amulets just lying around, I wouldn't hurry on this. (Ditto on Rusty Pendants and Gold, but you're more likely to actually have them lying around.) The Hunter Tokens just aren't worth as much in and of themselves. Still, fun little thing to do!

### Growing Improvement

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Jaihri
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Check out the list of quests Jaihri have to their name - there's quite a few! This will dovetail with a lot of quests in the regular game.

### Growth Pains

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS2 Quest: Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat:
  - 3 Osaril
  - 2 Trainees
  - 1 Furoxi
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** This can dovetail with a few Riza Rivertown quests, but otherwise, no hurries. Take at your own pace.
