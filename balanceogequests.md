## Floating City of Balance Main Quests

### Main Quest 1: Help From A Master

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Floating City of Balance
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 3 Dí Bags
- **Rewards:** 1 Water Mask
- **Recommendations:** I know the Dí Bags seem endless, but this is the last hurrah in the main quest line. Maybe play around in Riza sidequests for a while if this takes too long to grind, or (better yet) explore Raina Expedition and its more-bountiful River Water sources. And once you finish the first few Balance quests, the range of monsters and sidequests available really opens up.

### Main Quest 2: Underwater Training

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 1: Help From A Master
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Puna, 4 Sliv, and 3 Isartu
- **Rewards:** 3 Water Masks & 1 Underwater Torch
- **Recommendations:** This is where you start getting strategic about sidequests. There are a LOT of Battle sidequests in Balance. Heck, if you wanted, you could work on Gone Fishing AND any Puna sidequests you have left from Luciola or Gansu. You could work on River Landwalkers with the Isartu. Just remember that there are a LOT of Battle quests, and you won't be able to drop them from your Questbook and pick them up again. I would not prioritize any of the sidequests that dovetail with this one; unless you expect to be finishing them quickly, you'll have other uses for your quest slots. (OTOH if you're a fast completionist go ahead and save a couple battles by completing these now and getting ahead.)

### Main Quest 3: The Deep Dark

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 2: Underwater Training
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 8 Nuig, 2 Xyplos, and 2 Vezi
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest
- **Recommendations:** This one I *would* look for sidequests that dovetail, because 8 Nuig battles are a pity to use for only one. (Although be warned that if you want to complete every sidequest, there will be more of these ahead that you simply can't double up well.) Also, don't spring for Underwater Torches unless you have to. If your Luck is >17, you'll usually get one back for each one you use in battle. You won't be able to queue Xyplos or Vezi with a single Underwater Torch, but you might be able to fight them all one at a time with the start from the Torch you won from the last quest. (And if you open any River Chests, they'll get you more Underwater Torches. For those who love to queue.)

### Main Quest 4: Potion For A Goddess

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 3: The Deep Dark
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 12 Nuig String, 25 River Grass, 4 Vezi Shell, and 50 Dust
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest
- **Recommendations:** If these requirements are difficult, you probably haven't done enough of the battle sidequests. Go ahead and revel in those a bit. Some involve a fair amount of traveling, but that's just a good reason to put them all together and do them at once. Anyway, there's only one Main Quest left in Balance after this, so you might as well pace yourself.

### Main Quest 5: The Water Calls

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 4: Potion For A Goddess
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat the River Goddess
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest, Lodo as Companion, open Dark Forest Outpost 
- **Recommendations:** WATCH YOUR EQUIPMENT. 5K words in 72 hours? It might be worth shelling out for a Reinforced Steel Helmet and Reinforced Steel Breastplate first.  Put them together with a Steel Mace, a Harpoon, Steel Boots, and a Stone Ring? It'll take 3,847 words in 3 days and 16 hours, 55 minutes (so almost 4 days). Get a Sands Ring instead of a Stone Ring? 3,817 words in 17 hours, 38 minutes. If you want to figure out the best combo of equipment based on what you have, I have a list of everything here:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BxL_absfs8GyIiDwZRXuABNww43UbS1Qh_dJPDMU3Ig/edit#gid=199447042 And remember, while this is a big one for those of us used to less than 1K per day, it's very doable if you give yourself enough time.

## Floating City of Balance Sidequests

LAST UPDATED 8 OCT 2020

If there is an asterisk, it opens in the course of the game.

### ** The Abyss Stares Back

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 2: Underwater Training
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Xyplos
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest and 3 River Keys
- **Recommendations:** Depends on how much you like it! Those are some sweet rewards, but they're also some high costs. Be aware that a later sidequest asks for 20 Xyplos, so if you want to forestall this till then, it might save you a couple battles.

### ** Biodome Blossoms

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 2: Underwater Training
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 15 Vezi Shells
- **Rewards:** 1 Reinforced Steel Helmet
- **Recommendations:** You'll probably have to fight 6 Vezi for this, and it's still easily the cheapest way to get a Reinforced Steel Helmet, which has great stats. DOOOO IIIIT. If you're grinding this before Main Quest 4, though, make sure you get 19 Vezi Shells, not 15. You'll be glad you did.

### ** Cast Out Castu

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 1: Help From A Master
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 25 Castu, Deliver 10 Reinforced Rope, 10 Hardwood, and 5 Steel
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest
- **Recommendations:** If you're going to do this, pair it with the Curious Traveler quest that unlocks after all the Main Quests. MUCH more efficient. Also, hopefully at that point you'll have gotten enough River Chests open to make Reinforced Rope a less-expensive requirement.

### ** Colors to Die For

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 2: Underwater Training
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 15 Xyplos Ink, 25 Red Dye, and 20 Leafsung Ink
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: River Dye Hair https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;featured&#95;siren&#95;hair&#95;blue.png
- **Recommendations:** Sooooo pretty, the reward. Sooo infuriatingly expensive, the Leafsung Ink. Go fight the River Goddess till she drops enough River Chests to drop all of it, or fight Arenica and Desert Rudakai until they drop enough Golden Chests and you've collected enough Leafsung Keys from biweekly quests, and yes, that's probably the easiest way; if you try to obtain Leafsung Ink by crafting it, that's 60 Claws, 60 Dust, 100 Essence, and 100 Spider Poison. Oh, and Spider Poison and Xyplos Ink are only available as drops, no shortcuts to purchase them. If you do want to do it that way, do the Venomous Villains quest; you'll probably get 20 or so Spider Poison as a side benefit from the necessary battles right there. Elemental Power will get you another 5. And then… well, good luck.

### ** Curious Traveler

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 5: The Water Calls
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 20 Castu, 20 Awa, and 20 Xin
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest, unlock Part 2
- **Recommendations:** You're done with the main game anyway, right? This goes well with Cast Out Castu, and it goes along a quest line that keeps getting harder, but at least ends up with River Chests and really nifty goggles for your avatar.

### ** Curious Traveler Part 2

- **Unlocked by:** Curious Traveler
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 20 Sliv and 20 Isartu
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest, 1 River Key, unlock Part 3
- **Recommendations:** This is a good time to pair up with River Landwalkers, double your Isartu value. And no, this quest line doesn't get easier, so pace yourself.

### ** Curious Traveler Part 3

- **Unlocked by:** Curious Traveler Part 2
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 20 Vezi and 20 Xyplos
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Water Goggles
- **Recommendations:** Look at the pretty goggles! Looky! https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wm&#95;featured&#95;water&#95;googles.png Just think of that while you fight the monsters. Pick up The Abyss Stares Back if you haven't already and get two quests for the price of one. You can do it!!!

### ** Elemental Power

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 1: Help From A Master
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Illi, 5 Kiru, 5 Reenu, 5 Xin, and 5 Nuig
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest
- **Recommendations:** For those counting at home, this is a minimum of 4 Areas in 3 Regions (Reenu are available only in Luciola, Illi in Mama Tree, Kiru at this point in 3PC, and Nuig in Balance, with Xin everywhere). Which makes it pair really well with Venomous Villains, which also involves a lot of travel and Nuig. I personally like the excuse to travel and battle, but YMMV. And while you're traveling, consider those 5 Lorsa Nests for the Scouting Lorsa quest.

### Gone Fishing

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Floating City of Balance
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 25 Puna
- **Rewards:** 100 Coins
- **Recommendations:** This quest isn't worth a ton on its own (the Wooden Fishing Rods to fight Puna are pretty expensive, definitely more than 100 Coins). Definitely mix it with other Puna quests if possible, such as Balance's Main Quest 2 or the quests from prior regions. The Gone Fishing quest sequence has three long quests for a cumulative 375 Puna (con) and an absolutely gorgeous River Stone Necklace wardrobe item at the end (plus). Up to you.

### ** Gone Fishing Part 2

- **Unlocked by:** Gone Fishing
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 100 Puna
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest + 1 Wooden Key, Wardrobe: Puna Earrings
- **Recommendations:** Again, not worth much on its own. But if you're here, you've already defeated 25 Puna. What's 100 more? And there's funky Puna Earrings in it for you. https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;puna&#95;earrings.png And there's that lovely River Stone Necklace in the future.

### ** Gone Fishing Part 3

- **Unlocked by:** Gone Fishing Part 2
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 250 Puna
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: River Stone Necklace
- **Recommendations:** After you're done with this, you may never have to touch another Puna again. Isn't that a lovely thought? And you'll have the Necklace. Look! https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;featured&#95;crab&#95;necklace.png Isn't it gorgeous?

### ** It's Electric!

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 1: Help From A Master
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 10 Nuig String and 25 Algae
- **Rewards:** 3 River Keys
- **Recommendations:** Grab this as soon as it will be filled instantly. (If you're doing the Nuig sidequests, this will be pretty quickly. Or if you're doing any Castu sidequests.) 3 easy River Keys. OTOH Nuig String is a bit of a pain to grind deliberately, so probably don't do this if you're giving the Nuig and Castu sidequests a miss for now.

### River Landwalkers

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Floating City of Balance
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Isartu and 25 Caricaco
- **Rewards:** 250 Coins
- **Recommendations:** Isartu kindly drop River Stones, which are great if you're trying to buy anything in Raina, and Leather Rolls, which are great for Water Masks and fundraising. Caricaco are pretty darn easy. This does come to almost 15K words, but Attack values can offset that. On the flip side, there are at least two later quests that also require fighting Isartu, and one of them requires 20 of them, so it might be worth it to hold off on this till later. Might. Main Quest 2 only requires 3 Isartu, and the 20-Isartu quest is pretty deep in.

### ** Rudakai Master

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 5: The Water Calls
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Rudakai, 3 Desert Rudakai, and 3 Water Rudakai
- **Rewards:** 5 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** Do this after you've gotten as many River Chests and Keys as you're likely to get in the game, because you'll need Reinforced Rope to battle the Water Rudakai. (Well, as many River Chests and Keys as you're likely to get apart from Steel (Or Brace) Yourself; Reinforced Steel gear is very Reinforced-Rope expensive.) More travels ahead! Enjoy.

### Scouting Lorsa

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Floating City of Balance
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 5 Lorsa Nests
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest
- **Recommendations:** Depends on how many Lorsa Nests you've got on you. (Probably not a lot, and you'll have to travel back to the Desert or Forest to craft them.) Still, River Chests are pretty nice to have, and later sidequests will probably have you traveling anyway, so go for it when you're ready. (Unless, like me, you wish all Lorsa Nests would burn in the sun. Then wait till your anger cools a little. )

### Steel (Or Brace) Yourself

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Floating City of Balance
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 5 Reinforced Steel Helmets and 5 Reinforced Steel Breastplates
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest and 1 River Key
- **Recommendations:** Not now. For one, you'll definitely want to equip yourself with the first R.S. Helmet and Breastplate you can get, so you functionally need 6 of each. For another, 1 River Chest and 1 River Key are nowhere near as valuable as the items you're trading for them. But when you're running out of sidequests, this is a fun one to try to push through.

### ** Stingy Surprise

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 1: Help From A Master
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 30 Nuig
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: River Grass Skirt
- **Recommendations:** On one hand: that's a lot of Nuig, and a lot of Water Masks to battle them. On the other hand: that is a lovely skirt. Consider picking up this one at the same time as Elemental Powers and Venomous Villains and the start of Main Quest 3, and then you can knock out 30 Nuig and never touch them again.

### Tambo Snacks

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Floating City of Balance
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 100 Caricaco
- **Rewards:** 5 River Keys
- **Recommendations:** Consider mixing this with River Landwalkers whenever you do it (that's 25 Caricaco overlap you're looking at), but also consider saving both of them for later on. These are the kind of long-term battle quests that are worth saving to go in the background while you're collecting five billion Spider Poison for another quest.

### ** Venomous Villains

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 1: Help From A Master
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 7 Nuig, 7 Aracnu, 7 Ylly, and 7 Sparfly
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest and 1 River Key
- **Recommendations:** Again, for those counting at home, this is a minimum of 3 Areas in 3 Regions (Nuig available only in Balance, Ylly only in Gansu in the Desert, and Aracnu only in Luciola in the Forest; Sparfly might as well be picked up in Gansu while you're there). Which makes it pair really well with Elemental Powers, which also involves a lot of travel and Nuig. Don't forget to consider Nuig-heavy Stingy Surprise and Main Quest 3 at the same time. And while you're traveling, consider those 5 Lorsa Nests for the Scouting Lorsa quest.
