LAST UPDATED 4 MAY 2020

Streak rewards! The nice perks gained by maintaining your streak. **Feel free to skip straight down to the list that's all you care about, but note there's a reason I also list Wings separately at the end.**

So, this is something that's a little difficult to track (it's not like you can fight another dozen battles to check the drops, or restart the game and redo the quest; finding streak rewards is time-consuming).

It's also hard to manipulate. You can't just up and redo a Day 55 Streak Reward. (Although I would like to note that you *can* redo early Streak Rewards pretty easily, by breaking your streak and starting over; if you have enough Stempos to repair the break, you can afford to redo up to the Day 27 Streak Reward several times. Or, say, the Day 23 reward, if you're really desperate for Spider Poison. Don't forget to repair the streak *before* the 30-day limit, though, if you want it to get beyond that point.)

**I am not going to include Streak Rewards as sources of resources.** It's too finicky a way to farm, and too hard to keep reliable info. If you have any updates or corrections to offer, please let me know here: https://4thewords.com/forum/thread-streak-rewards-help

Also, 24 November 2019 saw a much-needed overhaul of the rewards which apparently hadn't changed substantially in two years. I'm currently including the outdated ones for the curious, and because I feel more confident saying "It used to be this" than "It will be this way when you find it", and because in a couple cases it's still all I know.
