## Riza Rivertown Main Quests

### Main Quest 1: Jaihri Dam

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Riza Rivertown
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 6 Jaihri
- **Rewards:** 100 Coins
- **Recommendations:** Make sure to pick up the River Dams sidequest at the same time to double up the Jaihri quest credit.

### Main Quest 2: Attack of Opportunity

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 1/Jaihri Dam
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 2 Yasri, 1 Bruja, and 2 Kiru
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest
- **Recommendations:** I honestly might go back to 3PC to fight these guys and stock up on the Quest 3 materials while at it. You'll need at least 10 Steel later, at least 3 Leaf Boots, a bunch of Rope, and weird things like Reenu Wings and Spider Poison. But by now, you've fought enough of these guys to know whether you want to stick around and how you want to approach them.

### Main Quest 3: Remedy for a Friend

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 2/Attack of Opportunity
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 6 Spider Poison, 6 Reenu Wings, 3 Desert Stone, 3 Glass Shards, 3 River Stones, 5 River Grass
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest
- **Recommendations:** It is what it is. The good news: this is the last Main Quest for a while that has requirements that might send you back to other regions.

### Main Quest 4: Mucky, Murky, Muddy

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 3/Remedy for a Friend
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 2 Jaihri, 4 Vota, 6 Yala, and 3 Knusha
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Key
- **Recommendations:** Mix and match as you see fit. This is straightforward.

### Main Quest 5: This Might Sting

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 4/Mucky, Murky, Muddy
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat Wyvern
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest
- **Recommendations:** I <3 the Wyvern. 24 hours to get 1300 words? And the drops? A lot simpler than the last one, and a welcome break before the next one.

### Main Quest 6: Journey Upriver

- **Unlocked by:** Main Quest 5/This Might Sting
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Gather 25 Hardwood, 10 Steel, and 5 Dí Bags
- **Rewards:** Floating City of Balance
- **Recommendations:** Dí Bags are usually easier to buy outright than to collect enough River Water to make. (And you'll be doing at least 3 more soon.) But if you want to do it the less-coin-intensive way, Yala are probably your best River Water source. (Osaril may be slightly more productive, but Vine Nets are harder to farm to get them). Hardwood is best gotten from Jaihri, hands down, and that'll help with the River Dams sidequest if you've been doing that.
