LAST UPDATED 5 MAR 2021

And now, all the quests for the Water Region. As with the Desert, I'm omitting any Main Quests outside this Region, and for non-Water Quests I'm listing only the name and location. Let's have a quick recap of how this works:

**The Main Quest Highway** is the main questline of the game, the backbone which unlocks everything else. This line, and only this line, will be defined solely by where it is in the sequence; the Route will tell you where it is in that sequence (LF MQ 3 for the third Main Quest in the Luciola Forest sequence, etc)

**The Expedition Trails** branch off of this Main Quest Highway (so does the **Hunt Trail**) at defined locations. The Route will tell you where it branches off the Main Quest Highway (i.e. which Main Quest unlocks the sidequest that unlocks the Expedition/Hunt) and list out all quests on that Trail. So the quest Joining the Hunt, located in Luciola Forest on the Hunt Trail would read "Hunt Trail Route: (available from game open) • **HuntS1 Joining the Hunt** • HuntS1 The Hunt Begins" etc.

**Quest Paths** are basically a questline off to the side, which don't lead anywhere in particular. To save myself space, they'll be allowed to jump off of Expedition Trails as well as Main Quests. So the quest Battle of Merit, which is unlocked by a quest which is unlocked by The Hunt Begins, would look thus: "Quest Path Route: (open via Hunt Trail HuntS1 The Hunt Begins) • HuntS1 A Battle of Wills • **HuntS1 Battle of Merit** • HuntS1 Battle of Constitution • HuntS1 A Battle of Evolution"

**Lone Quests** are quests which are unlocked by something on the Main Quest Highway or a Trail; instead of a Route, these will simply have an "Unlocked by" field.

#Main Quests, in Order of Unlocking

###(Luciola Forest, Mama Tree, Three Points Crossing and Gansu Watering Hole quests)

### Riza Main Quest 1: Jaihri Dam

- **Location:** Riza Rivertown
- **Main Quest Highway:** Riza MQ1
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 6 Jaihri
- **Rewards:** 100 Coins
- **Recommendations:** Make sure to pick up the River Dams sidequest at the same time to double up the Jaihri quest credit.

### Riza Main Quest 2: Attack of Opportunity

- **Location:** Riza Rivertown
- **Main Quest Highway:** Riza MQ2
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 2 Yasri, 1 Bruja, and 2 Kiru
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest
- **Recommendations:** I honestly might go back to 3PC to fight these guys and stock up on the Quest 3 materials while at it. You'll need at least 10 Steel later, at least 3 Leaf Boots, a bunch of Rope, and weird things like Reenu Wings and Spider Poison. But by now, you've fought enough of these guys to know whether you want to stick around and how you want to approach them.

### Riza Main Quest 3: Remedy for a Friend

- **Location:** Riza Rivertown
- **Main Quest Highway:** Riza MQ3
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 6 Spider Poison, 6 Reenu Wings, 3 Desert Stone, 3 Glass Shards, 3 River Stones, 5 River Grass
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest
- **Recommendations:** It is what it is. The good news: this is the last Main Quest for a while that has requirements that might send you back to other regions.

### Riza Main Quest 4: Mucky, Murky, Muddy

- **Location:** Riza Rivertown
- **Main Quest Highway:** Riza MQ4
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 2 Jaihri, 4 Vota, 6 Yala, and 3 Knusha
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Key
- **Recommendations:** Mix and match as you see fit. This is straightforward.

### Riza Main Quest 5: This Might Sting

- **Location:** Riza Rivertown
- **Main Quest Highway:** Riza MQ5
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat Wyvern
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest
- **Recommendations:** I <3 the Wyvern. 24 hours to get 1300 words? And the drops? A lot simpler than the last one, and a welcome break before the next one.

### Riza Main Quest 6: Journey Upriver

- **Location:** Riza Rivertown
- **Main Quest Highway:** Riza MQ6
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Gather 25 Hardwood, 10 Steel, and 5 Dí Bags
- **Rewards:** Floating City of Balance
- **Recommendations:** Dí Bags are usually easier to buy outright than to collect enough River Water to make. (And you'll be doing at least 3 more soon.) But if you want to do it the less-coin-intensive way, Yala are probably your best River Water source. (Osaril may be slightly more productive, but Vine Nets are harder to farm to get them). Hardwood is best gotten from Jaihri, hands down, and that'll help with the River Dams sidequest if you've been doing that.

### Balance Main Quest 1: Help From A Master

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Main Quest Highway:** Balance MQ1
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 3 Dí Bags
- **Rewards:** 1 Water Mask
- **Recommendations:** I know the Dí Bags seem endless, but this is the last hurrah in the main quest line. Maybe play around in Riza sidequests for a while if this takes too long to grind, or (better yet) explore Raina Expedition and its more-bountiful River Water sources. And once you finish the first few Balance quests, the range of monsters and sidequests available really opens up.

### Balance Main Quest 2: Underwater Training

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Main Quest Highway:** Balance MQ2
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Puna, 4 Sliv, and 3 Isartu
- **Rewards:** 3 Water Masks & 1 Underwater Torch
- **Recommendations:** This is where you start getting strategic about sidequests. There are a LOT of Battle sidequests in Balance. Heck, if you wanted, you could work on Gone Fishing AND any Puna sidequests you have left from Luciola or Gansu. You could work on River Landwalkers with the Isartu. Just remember that there are a LOT of Battle quests, and you won't be able to drop them from your Questbook and pick them up again. I would not prioritize any of the sidequests that dovetail with this one; unless you expect to be finishing them quickly, you'll have other uses for your quest slots. (OTOH if you're a fast completionist go ahead and save a couple battles by completing these now and getting ahead.)

### Balance Main Quest 3: The Deep Dark

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Main Quest Highway:** Balance MQ3
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 8 Nuig, 2 Xyplos, and 2 Vezi
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest
- **Recommendations:** This one I *would* look for sidequests that dovetail, because 8 Nuig battles are a pity to use for only one. (Although be warned that if you want to complete every sidequest, there will be more of these ahead that you simply can't double up well.) Also, don't spring for Underwater Torches unless you have to. If your Luck is >17, you'll usually get one back for each one you use in battle. You won't be able to queue Xyplos or Vezi with a single Underwater Torch, but you might be able to fight them all one at a time with the start from the Torch you won from the last quest. (And if you open any River Chests, they'll get you more Underwater Torches. For those who love to queue.)

### Balance Main Quest 4: Potion For A Goddess

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Main Quest Highway:** Balance MQ4
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 12 Nuig String, 25 River Grass, 4 Vezi Shell, and 50 Dust
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest
- **Recommendations:** If these requirements are difficult, you probably haven't done enough of the battle sidequests. Go ahead and revel in those a bit. Some involve a fair amount of traveling, but that's just a good reason to put them all together and do them at once. Anyway, there's only one Main Quest left in Balance after this, so you might as well pace yourself.

### Balance Main Quest 5: The Water Calls

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Main Quest Highway:** Balance MQ5
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat the River Goddess
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest, Lodo as Companion, open Dark Forest Outpost 
- **Recommendations:** WATCH YOUR EQUIPMENT. 5K words in 72 hours? It might be worth shelling out for a Reinforced Steel Helmet and Reinforced Steel Breastplate first.  Put them together with a Steel Mace, a Harpoon, Steel Boots, and a Stone Ring? It'll take 3,847 words in 3 days and 16 hours, 55 minutes (so almost 4 days). Get a Sands Ring instead of a Stone Ring? 3,817 words in 17 hours, 38 minutes. If you want to figure out the best combo of equipment based on what you have, I have a list of everything here:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BxL&#95;absfs8GyIiDwZRXuABNww43UbS1Qh&#95;dJPDMU3Ig/edit#gid=199447042 And remember, while this is a big one for those of us used to less than 1K per day, it's very doable if you give yourself enough time.

# Side Quests, in Alphabetical Order A-M

LAST UPDATED 5 MAR 2021

### 4 the Infected - SurfaceC

- **Location:** Raina Surface Camp

### The Abyss Stares Back - Balance

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Unlocked by:** Balance MQ2: Underwater Training
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Xyplos
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest and 3 River Keys
- **Recommendations:** Depends on how much you like it! Those are some sweet rewards, but they're also some high costs. Be aware that a later sidequest asks for 20 Xyplos, so if you want to forestall this till then, it might save you a couple battles.

### Amateur Fisherman - Riza

- **Location:** Riza Rivertown
- **Quest Path:** (open via Main Quest Highway Gansu MQ8/Dust to Dust) • **Amateur Fisherman** • Riza Apprentice Fisherman • Riza Water Tribe Stripes
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Patliadu
- **Rewards:** 25 Coins
- **Recommendations:** Completing this opens up another quest that can net you a Stone Key. Otherwise, it doesn't have anything to recommend it except a sense of satisfaction in Completing The Things. If you want to also do Battle Ready and/or Osaril Nests, do them first for maximum Harpoon efficiency.

### Apprentice Fisherman - Riza

- **Location:** Riza Rivertown
- **Quest Path:** (open via Main Quest Highway Gansu MQ8/Dust to Dust) • Riza Amateur Fisherman • **Apprentice Fisherman** • Riza Water Tribe Stripes
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 8 Patliadu
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Key
- **Recommendations:** Go for it! If you're planning on doing Osaril Nests, though, make sure you do it first: the Harpoons will be helpful in the Patliadu battles. And do the Battle Ready quest first. You'll get to keep the Harpoons you gather for it, and can then use them on Patliadu.

### Au-some Frog Race - SacredS

####NOTE: Important Info in Recommendations

- **Location:** Raina Sacred Site

- **Unlocked by:** Raina Expedition Trail: SwampL Twisted Treacherous Trails (2/2)

- **Type:** Battle

- **Requirements:** Defeat 1000 Kuldoro

- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Kuldoro Pet https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;772-golden-frog-pet-5280-13978.png

- **Recommendations:** That's a lot of Kuldoro. Good thing you can work on the quest without picking it up.

  Repeat: as of this writing when the site opens up, this quest counts every Kuldoro you've ever battled, whether you were carrying the quest or not.

  So you are 100% free to pick this up and put it down at your convenience, same as a Collection quest.

  And congrats to Jess Mountifield for inspiring this quest with her ambitious self-challenge during the special event! https://4thewords.com/forum/thread-1000-gold-froggies/1

### Barge Weights - Riza

- **Location:** Riza Rivertown
- **Unlocked by:** Riza MQ6/Journey Upriver
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Gather 35 River Stones
- **Rewards:** 2 Stone Keys
- **Recommendations:** Grab it! The Floating City of Balance has places to get River Stones more easily than Riza; it's worth the effort.

###Base Camp Clearing Duty  - HuntS1.2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library

### Battle Experience - Gansu

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Unlocked by:** 3PC MQ5/A Way South

### Battle of Constitution (3/4) - HuntS1

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via Hunt Trail HuntS1 The Hunt Begins) • HuntS1 A Battle of Wills • HuntS1 Battle of Merit • **Battle of Constitution** • HuntS1 A Battle of Evolution

### A Battle of Evolution 4/4 - HuntS1

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via Hunt Trail HuntS1 The Hunt Begins) • HuntS1 A Battle of Wills • HuntS1 Battle of Merit • HuntS1 Battle of Constitution • **A Battle of Evolution**

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via Hunt Trail HuntS1 The Hunt Begins) • HuntS1 A Battle of Wills • **Battle of Merit** • HuntS1 Battle of Constitution • HuntS1 A Battle of Evolution

### A Battle of Wills - HuntS1

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via Hunt Trail HuntS1 The Hunt Begins) • **A Battle of Wills** • HuntS1 Battle of Merit • HuntS1 Battle of Constitution • HuntS1 A Battle of Evolution

### Battle Practice - Riza

- **Location:** Riza Rivertown
- **Unlocked by:** Gansu MQ8/Dust to Dust
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Trainees
- **Rewards:** 3 Stone Keys
- **Recommendations:** 1000 words in 60 minutes is no joke; doing it 10 times over is a real challenge. 3 Stone Keys are a really nice reward, though. I'd recommend picking this up, and if the pace is too punishing, write offsite and give yourself a little extra time. Trainee drops are good enough to make up for the extra effort, IMHO.

### Battle Ready - Riza

- **Location:** Riza Rivertown
- **Unlocked by:** Gansu MQ8/Dust to Dust
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Have at least 10 Harpoons in Inventory (and keep after turning in the quest!)
- **Rewards:** 25 Coins
- **Recommendations:** Do it. You get to keep the Harpoons, you will almost certainly want the Harpoons for hunting Patliadu at some point, and they're great Weapon2s anyway. If you do the Osaril Nests first, though, you'll get a couple Harpoons that way.

### Bettering Ourselves - HuntS3

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Hunt Trail Route:** (unlocked via LF MQ4/Don't Regift Curses) • MT The Winding Path to Elder Library • HuntS1 Joining the Hunt • HuntS1 The Hunt Begins • HuntS1 Deeper Forest Hunting • HuntS1 A Past Not Forgotten • HuntS1 The Curator of Elder Library • HuntS2 All Who Wander • HuntS2 Oh, Endless Possibilities! • HuntS2 No Wrong Path • Hunt S2 Stumbling Upon Sheep • HuntS3 To Grow & Change • **Bettering Ourselves** • HuntS3 Bigger & Brighter • HuntS3 A Bubble Dream • HuntS4 Dirt to Dust • HuntS4 Celebrate Joy • HuntS4 Still Missing Something • HuntS4 Proving Your Friendship

- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Complex Brooch https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;651-hunt-complex-brooch-3813-44800.png
- **Recommendations:** The Season of Growth is certainly encouraging us to build our Streaks!

- **Recommendations:** Still streaking! (Sorry, couldn't resist.) And as of this writing, still waiting to see what gets unlocked next by this one! But the Caretaker will almost certainly require this quest to unlock.

### Biodome Blossoms - Balance

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Unlocked by:** Balance MQ2: Underwater Training
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 15 Vezi Shells
- **Rewards:** 1 Reinforced Steel Helmet
- **Recommendations:** You'll probably have to fight 6 Vezi for this, and it's still easily the cheapest way to get a Reinforced Steel Helmet, which has great stats. DOOOO IIIIT. If you're grinding this before Main Quest 4, though, make sure you get 19 Vezi Shells, not 15. You'll be glad you did.

Note: technically, this appears as soon as you open Guardian's Lair whether you've completed the previous quest or not. But since you can't pick it up until the other one is completed, I'm counting this as a quest path.

- **Location:** Guardian's Lair
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via Forest Expedition Trail: BC Hard Day's Walk) • FB Blossom with Flowers! 1/2 • **Bright Night Blossoms (2/2)**

### Cast Out Castu - Balance

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Unlocked by:** Balance MQ1/ Help From A Master
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 25 Castu, Deliver 10 Reinforced Rope, 10 Hardwood, and 5 Steel
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest
- **Recommendations:** If you're going to do this, pair it with the Curious Traveler quest that unlocks after all the Main Quests. MUCH more efficient. Also, hopefully at that point you'll have gotten enough River Chests open to make Reinforced Rope a less-expensive requirement.

### Catching Glints of Sunrise - Hideout

- **Location:** Rebel Raina Hideout
- **Unlocked by:** Raina Expedition Trail: SacredS A Worthy Offering

- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS2 Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Yala
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** ... you'll complete this anyway if you complete Growth in Friendship, so it overlaps well. If you can't do Growth in Friendship because you haven't unlocked Raina, this is a nice consolation prize.

### Colors to Die For - Balance

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Unlocked by:** Balance MQ2: Underwater Training
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 15 Xyplos Ink, 25 Red Dye, and 20 Leafsung Ink
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: River Dye Hair https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;featured&#95;siren&#95;hair&#95;blue.png
- **Recommendations:** Sooooo pretty, the reward. Sooo infuriatingly expensive, the Leafsung Ink. Go fight the River Goddess till she drops enough River Chests to drop all of it, or fight Arenica and Desert Rudakai until they drop enough Golden Chests and you've collected enough Leafsung Keys from biweekly quests, and yes, that's probably the easiest way; if you try to obtain Leafsung Ink by crafting it, that's 60 Claws, 60 Dust, 100 Essence, and 100 Spider Poison. Oh, and Spider Poison and Xyplos Ink are only available as drops, no shortcuts to purchase them. If you do want to do it that way, do the Venomous Villains quest; you'll probably get 20 or so Spider Poison as a side benefit from the necessary battles right there. Elemental Power will get you another 5. And then… well, good luck.

- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 20 Castu, 20 Awa, and 20 Xin
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest, unlock Part 2
- **Recommendations:** You're done with the main game anyway, right? This goes well with Cast Out Castu, and it goes along a quest line that keeps getting harder, but at least ends up with River Chests and really nifty goggles for your avatar.

- **Recommendations:** Look at the pretty goggles! Looky! https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wm&#95;featured&#95;water&#95;googles.png Just think of that while you fight the monsters. Pick up The Abyss Stares Back if you haven't already and get two quests for the price of one. You can do it!!!

- **Requirements:** Gather 10 Dí Bags
- **Rewards:** 1 Stempo
- **Recommendations:** Do… do you really want to do this? It's up to you. When I repeat the game multiple times, it's pretty easy to scrounge up 6500 Coins to buy this and cash out. But there are so many cheaper ways to get Stempos, and so many better uses for the resources it takes to get Dí. Completionists only, and I'd save for later even then.

- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Illi, 5 Kiru, 5 Reenu, 5 Xin, and 5 Nuig
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest
- **Recommendations:** For those counting at home, this is a minimum of 4 Areas in 3 Regions (Reenu are available only in Luciola, Illi in Mama Tree, Kiru at this point in 3PC, and Nuig in Balance, with Xin everywhere). Which makes it pair really well with Venomous Villains, which also involves a lot of travel and Nuig. I personally like the excuse to travel and battle, but YMMV. And while you're traveling, consider those 5 Lorsa Nests for the Scouting Lorsa quest.

- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS2 Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Nuig
- **Rewards:** Hunt Map Piece 8, 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** The Season of Growth seems to be favoring us with a gentler way to obtain Hunt Map Pieces so far - we do NOT need to complete Moving Flora to unlock this quest. Still, we do need to complete this one to continue on the Hunt Map Pieces chain, so let's dig in.

### Golden Tooth Monsters - SurfaceC

- **Location:** Raina Surface Camp
- **Unlocked by:** Raina Expedition Trail: Raina Surface Camp (Riza quest)
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 15 Jaihri
- **Rewards:** 3 Harpoons
- **Recommendations:** You'll have to go back to Riza to fight Jaihri, but... go ahead and go for it! Those Harpoons are always nice to have on hand, and Jaihri get you lots of valuable Hardwood (which at this point, you may be wanting to think about selling for Coins).

### Gone Fishing - Balance

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Quest Path:** (open via Riza MQ6/Journey Upriver) • **Gone Fishing** • Balance Gone Fishing Part 2 • Balance Gone Fishing Part 3
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 25 Puna
- **Rewards:** 100 Coins
- **Recommendations:** This quest isn't worth a ton on its own (the Wooden Fishing Rods to fight Puna are pretty expensive, definitely more than 100 Coins). Definitely mix it with other Puna quests if possible, such as Balance's Main Quest 2 or the quests from prior regions. The Gone Fishing quest sequence has three long quests for a cumulative 375 Puna (con) and an absolutely gorgeous River Stone Necklace wardrobe item at the end (plus). Up to you.

### Gone Fishing Part 2 - Balance

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Quest Path:** (open via Riza MQ6/Journey Upriver) • Balance Gone Fishing • **Gone Fishing Part 2** • Balance Gone Fishing Part 3
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 100 Puna
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest + 1 Wooden Key, Wardrobe: Puna Earrings
- **Recommendations:** Again, not worth much on its own. But if you're here, you've already defeated 25 Puna. What's 100 more? And there's funky Puna Earrings in it for you. https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;puna&#95;earrings.png And there's that lovely River Stone Necklace in the future.

### Gone Fishing Part 3 - Balance

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Quest Path:** (open via Riza MQ6/Journey Upriver) • Balance Gone Fishing • Balance Gone Fishing Part 2 • **Gone Fishing Part 3** 
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 250 Puna
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: River Stone Necklace
- **Recommendations:** After you're done with this, you may never have to touch another Puna again. Isn't that a lovely thought? And you'll have the Necklace. Look! https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;featured&#95;crab&#95;necklace.png Isn't it gorgeous?

- **Quest Path:** (open via Hunt Trail: HuntS2 Stumbling Upon Sheep) • **Growing Improvement** • HuntS3 Growing Your Perception 2/3 • HuntS3 Growing Your Tenacity 3/3 • HuntS3 Growing Your Valor 4/4
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Jaihri
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Check out the list of quests Jaihri have to their name - there's quite a few! This will dovetail with a lot of quests in the regular game.

### Growing Your Perception 2/3 - HuntS3

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Quest Path:** (open via Hunt Trail: HuntS2 Stumbling Upon Sheep) • HuntS3 Growing Improvement • **Growing Your Perception 2/3** • HuntS3 Growing Your Tenacity 3/3 • HuntS3 Growing Your Valor 4/4
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Castu, 3 Isartu, and 1 Water Rudakai
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** A lot here rides on how much you like the monsters, and how much you like the rewards. You'll probably want to see whether, as in previous Seasons, this questline culminates in a fifth quest with a nifty wardrobe reward. (I'm writing this just as this quest released and the chain is only three quests long; hopefully I remember to update when the answer drops next month.) In the meantime, you may want to keep up just to save time later, or you may want to take your time.

### Growing Your Tenacity 3/3 - HuntS3

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Quest Path:** (open via Hunt Trail: HuntS2 Stumbling Upon Sheep) • HuntS3 Growing Improvement • HuntS3 Growing Your Perception 2/3 • **Growing Your Tenacity 3/3** • HuntS3 Growing Your Valor 4/4
- **Type:** Battle 
- **Requirements:** Defeat 2 Xyplos
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Same as the previous quest: depends whether it appeals and whether you like the prospect of the end of the questline.

### Growing Your Valor 4/4 - HuntS3

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Quest Path:** (open via Hunt Trail: HuntS2 Stumbling Upon Sheep) • HuntS3 Growing Improvement • HuntS3 Growing Your Perception 2/3 • HuntS3 Growing Your Tenacity 3/3 • **Growing Your Valor 4/4** 
- **Type:** Battle 
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Wyvern
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Fur Ankle Boots https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;Boots&#95;Ankle&#95;Fur&#95;Black.png
- **Recommendations:** I'm personally quite fond of Wyverns, so for me this is a no-brainer. Given that it's unlocked. I don't think I'd rush through the "Growing" line for this.

### Growth & Restoration - SacredS

- **Location:** Raina Sacred Site
- **Unlocked by:** Raina Expedition Trail: SwampL Twisted Treacherous Trails (2/2)
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Ognimaf and deliver 50 Swamp Moss
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest and Wardrobe: Small Gold Crown https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;733-raina-gold-crown-small-4796-18014.png
- **Recommendations:** It's small, it's cheap, it gets you a River Chest. Go for it!

### Growth in Friendship - HuntS3

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS2 Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each: Rea & Pira, Yala, Knusha, Vota, Vaktra, Droxa, Begala
- **Rewards:** 50 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** This pairs really well with at least one Surface Camp quest, so keep an eye out for that. Just.... don't fight any of these monsters in Riza, because you'll be paying more Resources than you would fighting them in Raina.

### Growth Pains - HuntS3

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS2 Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat:
  - 3 Osaril
  - 2 Trainees
  - 1 Furoxi
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** This can dovetail with a few Riza Rivertown quests, but otherwise, no hurries. Take at your own pace.

### Guard Your Feet - 3PC

- **Quest Path:** (open via Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On) • Shrine0 Keeper of the Shrine 1/3 • **Helper of the Shrine 2/3** • Shrine0 Guardian of the Shrine 3/3

### Helping A Mother - ShrineDucks

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Desert Expedition Trail: Ruins Tunnel Locked On, and Wardrobe: Ducks Time Bracelet

### Helping Those In Need Grow - HuntS3

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS2 Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver:
  - 10 Rusty Amulets
  - 5 Rusty Pendants
  - 1 Gold Bar
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Unless you have 10 Rusty Amulets just lying around, I wouldn't hurry on this. (Ditto on Rusty Pendants and Gold, but you're more likely to actually have them lying around.) The Hunter Tokens just aren't worth as much in and of themselves. Still, fun little thing to do!

### Herding the Herders - HuntS2

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS2 No Wrong Path

### Huge, Gigantic, Enormous - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** LF MQ4

- **Location:** Elder Library

### Infected Raina Part 1 - SurfaceC

- **Location:** Raina Surface Camp
- **Quest Path:** (open via Raina Expedition Trail: Raina Surface Camp (Riza quest)) • **Infected Raina Part 1** • SurfaceC Infected Raina Part 2 • SurfaceC Infected Raina Part 3 • SurfaceC 4 The Infected
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Vota, 5 Knusha, & Pay 10 Nets, and 10 Leaves
- **Rewards:** 1 Dust Water, unlock Infected Raina 2
- **Recommendations:** We mentioned that this is the region of convoluted sidequests, yes? Infected Raina 3 has some nice benefits. So for this, go ahead and fight your battles for Vota and Knusha, then go to the Forest to farm Vine Nets and Leaves as needed. Or pursue the Hunt Quests against Velts, the ones that start with "Battle of", to eventually unlock Dust Velts, who drops Nets. (And I'd *strongly recommend* getting a jump on Infected Raina Part 2 before turning this in, for morale. That means 30 MORE Rope, 30 MORE Leaves, and 30 MORE Nets, plus all the Rope and River Grass to fight more Vota and Knusha, which means you'll probably need to farm 40 Vine Nets in Mama Tree, have 40 Leaves, then head over to the Desert and get 40 Steel and 40 Stone and craft your Nets). (And if you want to go all the way through to Part 4, that's up by 45 more for each of the above.) If you do the battles last, you might be able to pick up the next quest immediately and enjoy the benefits of overlap.

### Infected Raina Part 2 - SurfaceC

- **Location:** Raina Surface Camp
- **Quest Path:** (open via Raina Expedition Trail: Raina Surface Camp (Riza quest)) • SurfaceC Infected Raina Part 1 • **Infected Raina Part 2** • SurfaceC Infected Raina Part 3 • SurfaceC 4 The Infected
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Pay 30 Net and 30 Leaves, and defeat 10 Vota, 10 Knusha, 10 Yala
- **Rewards:** 2 Dust Water, 1 River Chest, unlock Infected Raina 3
- **Recommendations:** Again, I'd do the battles first and then roam to the Forest and Desert to collect the rest. The resource calculators are almost required at this point.

### Infected Raina Part 3 - SurfaceC

- **Location:** Raina Surface Camp
- **Quest Path:** (open via Raina Expedition Trail: Raina Surface Camp (Riza quest)) • SurfaceC Infected Raina Part 1 • SurfaceC Infected Raina Part 2 • **Infected Raina Part 3** • SurfaceC 4 The Infected
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Wyverns
- **Rewards:** 3 Dust Water, Wardrobe: Raina Mask https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wm&#95;featured&#95;raina&#95;mask.png , ability to craft Raina Sword and Raina Bracelet
- **Recommendations:** Almost there! You got FORTY NETS, this is a piece of cake in comparison! (Start collecting River Stones; you'll need 1000 of them to get both your shiny new beauties in the store.)

### Inking By Number (2/5) - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Quest Path Route:** (open via MT MQ 4/ Aid To An Elder) • MT Tinkering With Leafsung (1/5) • **Inking By Number (2/5)** • MT Inking of Dust (3/5) • MT Thinking of Ink (4/5) • MT Invisible Ink (5/5)

### Insight Grows - HuntS3

- **Location:** Elder Library
- **Unlocked by:** Hunt Trail: HuntS2 Stumbling Upon Sheep
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 20 Puna
- **Rewards:** 15 Hunter Tokens & Hunt Map Piece 9
- **Recommendations:** The trend continues! Once again, the quest to get Hunt Map Piece 9 does not depend on the quest to get Hunt Map Piece 8. (One of my test accounts is in the interesting position of possessing Hunt Map Piece 9 and not 8.) Still, you'll need this to keep the main Hunt line going, so I suppose it's worth the Puna. (There are approximately 423,293,478 Puna quests in the game, and after completing all of them, I'm rather tired of the fishies. For those who have not completed them, I recommend checking out what quests overlap, especially in Balance.)

- **Recommendations:** Grab this as soon as it will be filled instantly. (If you're doing the Nuig sidequests, this will be pretty quickly. Or if you're doing any Castu sidequests.) 3 easy River Keys. OTOH Nuig String is a bit of a pain to grind deliberately, so probably don't do this if you're giving the Nuig and Castu sidequests a miss for now.

### Osaril Nests - Riza

- **Location:** Riza Rivertown
- **Unlocked by:** Gansu MQ8/Dust to Dust
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Osaril
- **Rewards:** 2 Harpoons
- **Recommendations:** Great for helping with the Battle Ready quest, and for hunting Patliadu with Amateur and Apprentice Fisherman; not-so-great use of Vine Nets, which suddenly look a lot more precious if you take up the giant later-game sidequests that require 120 of them. If you have a sane sense of proportion and can pace yourself, though, there's no reason not to do it.

### Our Waymark Stones - HuntS2

- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 20 Caricaco
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Check out other Caricaco quests in Balance before completing this. There's a reason the info for this quest references "Tambo Snacks". "River Walkers" is also worth doubling up with this.

### Pushing Back Rebels (1/3) - Hideout

- **Location:** Rebel Raina Hideout
- **Quest Path:** (open via Raina Expedition Trail: SacredS A Worthy Offering) • **Pushing Back Rebels 1/3** • Pushing Back Rebels 2/3 (Hideout quest) • Pushing Back Rebels 3/3 (Hideout quest)
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each: Cafodu, Drau, Wisthu, Grongu
- **Rewards:** 5 Reinforced Rope and Wardrobe: Large Gold Crown https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;732-raina-gold-crown-large-4794-33911.png
- **Recommendations:** I like the challenge of this line, but admittedly some might find it less than incredibly useful. It is, however, an excellent excuse to battle several monsters with excellent drops. (And for this one, an excellent crown.) This particular quest doubles with Knocking Down Rebels, as they have the same requirements.

### Pushing Back Rebels (2/3) - Hideout

- **Location:** Rebel Raina Hideout
- **Quest Path:** (open via Raina Expedition Trail: SacredS A Worthy Offering) • Pushing Back Rebels 1/3 (Hideout quest) • **Pushing Back Rebels 2/3** • Pushing Back Rebels 3/3 (Hideout quest)
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 each: Cafodu, Drau, Wisthu, Grongu
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest & 1 River Key
- **Recommendations:** Again, the reward of fighting the monsters is greater than the result, unless you're particularly fond of the final bit of the chain.

### Pushing Back Rebels (3/3) - Hideout

- **Location:** Rebel Raina Hideout
- **Quest Path:** (open via Raina Expedition Trail: SacredS A Worthy Offering) • Pushing Back Rebels 1/3 (Hideout quest) • Pushing Back Rebels 2/3 (Hideout quest) • **Pushing Back Rebels 3/3** 
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 each: Cafodu, Drau, Wisthu, Grongu
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Raina Golden Warrior Mask https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;779-golden-facemask-5298-53682.png
- **Recommendations:** Why are you looking at this? Like you were going to complete the first two parts and not the final one? Ha. Nah, just go ahead and finish it out.

### Quench a Thirst - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** Riza MQ6/Journey Upriver
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 25 Dí Bags
- **Rewards:** 3 Wooden Chest, 1 Wooden Key, and 3 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** Those chests, that key, and those Stempos are mighty nice, but those Dí Bags are mighty expensive. I'd recommend saving this at least until you've done everything you want to do in the Water Region (quests, battles, etc) so that you can take maximum advantage of what River Water you accrue on the way.

### Question to Axe - DigS

- **Location:** Dig Site
- **Desert Expedition Trail:** (open via Gansu MQ8/Dust to Dust) • Gansu Digging Into Desert Sands • **Question to Axe** • IN ANY ORDER: [ Ruins Searching South • Ruins Navigating North • Ruins Withdrawing West • Ruins Excavating East ] • Ruins Tunnel Locked On • (access to Shrine of Ages)

### Raina Surface Camp - Riza

- **Location:** Riza Rivertown
- **Raina Expedition Trail Route:** (open via Main Quest Highway Riza MQ6/Journey Upriver) • **Raina Surface Camp** • SurfaceC Energy Now, Tired Later • SwampL Wading Through & Onwards (1/2) • SwampL Twisted Treacherous Trails (2/2) • SacredS A Worthy Offering
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Yala and 5 Vota
- **Rewards:** Unlock Raina Surface Camp
- **Recommendations:** Do it! This area is a lot of fun, and a lot of water resources are marginally easier to grind in the Raina Expedition.

### Rebuild the Watering Hole - Gansu

- **Location:** Gansu Watering Hole
- **Quest Path:** (open via Gansu MQ8) • **Rebuild the Watering Hole** • Gansu Respark the Flame • Gansu Local Shrine • Gansu First Stempo • (ability to craft Stempos), MT Study Break Time

### Recovering Stolen Goods - MSite

### River Dams - Riza

- **Location:** Riza Rivertown
- **Unlocked by:** Gansu MQ8/Dust to Dust
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 15 Jaihri
- **Rewards:** 100 Coins
- **Recommendations:** Pick it up immediately; you'll be fighting 8 Jaihri for Main Quests anyway, and might as well get credit for them. (Though if you want to be hyper-efficient and also hyper-completionist, wait to fight the other 7 Jaihri till you open Raina Surface Camp and pick up the Jaihri quest there.)

### River Grass Supply - Riza

- **Location:** Riza Rivertown
- **Unlocked by:** Gansu MQ8/Dust to Dust
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Gather 50 River Grass
- **Rewards:** 1 Steel Boots
- **Recommendations:** This is probably an easy win, and the cheapest way to get Steel Boots in the game. However, if you don't have a ton of River Grass on hand, consider saving it till the end of Riza. There's no penalty for waiting, and you'll have a better sense of supply then.

### River Landwalkers - Balance

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Unlocked by:** Riza MQ6/Journey Upriver
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Isartu and 25 Caricaco
- **Rewards:** 250 Coins
- **Recommendations:** Isartu kindly drop River Stones, which are great if you're trying to buy anything in Raina, and Leather Rolls, which are great for Water Masks and fundraising. Caricaco are pretty darn easy. This does come to almost 15K words, but Attack values can offset that. On the flip side, there are at least two later quests that also require fighting Isartu, and one of them requires 20 of them, so it might be worth it to hold off on this till later. Might. Main Quest 2 only requires 3 Isartu, and the 20-Isartu quest is pretty deep in.

### River Water For…? - MT

- **Location:** Mama Tree
- **Unlocked by:** Riza MQ6/Journey Upriver
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 10 River Water
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest, 1 Wooden Key, & 1 Leafsung Ink
- **Recommendations:** Do you have extra River Water lying around after all the Dí requirements in the main quests? Then sure! Otherwise, give it a pass for now.

### Rudakai Master - Balance

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Unlocked by:** Balance MQ5/The Water Calls
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Rudakai, 3 Desert Rudakai, and 3 Water Rudakai
- **Rewards:** 5 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** Do this after you've gotten as many River Chests and Keys as you're likely to get in the game, because you'll need Reinforced Rope to battle the Water Rudakai. (Well, as many River Chests and Keys as you're likely to get apart from Steel (Or Brace) Yourself; Reinforced Steel gear is very Reinforced-Rope expensive.) More travels ahead! Enjoy.

- **Rewards:** 3 River Water and Wardrobe: Bone Nose Piercing https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;719-bone-nose-piercing-4712-76828.png
- **Recommendations:** This is great if you're trying to make some more Dí Bags, since you get not only the reward River Water but also the River Water dropped by the Auwi on the way. Otherwise, up to you.

### Save the Children

- **Location:** Luciola Forest
- **Unlocked by:** available at game open

### Scouting Lorsa - Balance

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Unlocked by:** Riza MQ6/Journey Upriver
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 5 Lorsa Nests
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest
- **Recommendations:** Depends on how many Lorsa Nests you've got on you. (Probably not a lot, and you'll have to travel back to the Desert or Forest to craft them.) Still, River Chests are pretty nice to have, and later sidequests will probably have you traveling anyway, so go for it when you're ready. (Unless, like me, you wish all Lorsa Nests would burn in the sun. Then wait till your anger cools a little.)

- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each:

- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Turn in 25 Spider Bows
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Key & 1 Stone Chest
- **Recommendations:** Definitely worth turning in if you have 25 Spider Bows or more already. If you're going to tackle the Raina quests, you'll probably accrue all the Spider Bows you need later while using Wooden Chests in Mama Tree to get Vine Nets. Probably no reason to specifically farm Spider Bows for it, though.

### Steel Boots - SurfaceC

(THIS IS MUCH LONGER THAN USUAL; bear with me.)

- **Location:** Raina Surface Camp
- **Unlocked by:** Raina Expedition Trail: Raina Surface Camp (Riza quest)
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Pay 25 Steel Boots
- **Rewards:** 1 Dust Water (what's this good for? Who knows? Nothing yet.) and 3 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** THE EVIL QUEST OF EVIL. This is OBSCENELY expensive. 
  - Each Steel Boot needs 3 Steel Bars and 1 Fabric Boot (among other items) to build. Each Fabric Boot needs 100 Coins, 3 Leafsung Boots, some Fine Fabric, Raw Fabric, and a Steel Bar to build. Each Leafsung Boot requires 2 Leaf Boots and 1 Leafsung Ink to build. Each Leafsung Ink requires 5 Essence, 5 Spider Poison, 3 Claws, and 3 Dust. 
  - So in short, if you drill down, each Steel Boot requires that you build one Fabric Boot, from Leafsung Boots, from Leaf Boots and Leafsung Ink, and Steel Bars, which means each Steel Boot needs 100 Coins, 9 Claws, 9 Dust, 15 Essence, 1 Fine Fabric, 6 Leaf Boots, 45 Leaves, 4 Raw Fabric, 2 River Grass, 15 Spider Poison, and 4 Steel Bars, which very likely will need to be made from 12 Raw Steel and 12 Wood.
  - EACH. BOOT.
  - First: make sure you've completed River Grass Supply in Riza to get the cheapest pair of Steel Boots in the game.
  - Second: make sure you've completed the Tailor quest in 3PC for the cheapest pair of Fabric Boots in the game.
  - Third: consider redoing the entire game a few times to chalk up a few more of these cheaper boots, because they're less mind-numbing than farming all the necessary materials.
    - If you decide just to take the quest right now after doing First and Second parts, you'll need 2300 Coins, 207 Claws, 207 Dust, 345 Essence, 23 Fine Fabric, 138 Leaf Boots, 1035 Leaves,  92 Raw Fabric, 48 River Grass, 345 Spider Poison (which will, at the best efficiency, require 138,000 battle-words in 345 battles against Aracni), and 95 Steel Bars, and all you get for it will be one. single. Dust Water, which has no apparent use so far and can't be sold. Consider very carefully.
    - Seriously, consider completing this quest on a later pass. It'll be less tedious spread over completing other quests.
  - Fourth: Make sure you've completed the Make X Sing series of quests in Luciola Forest so you'll be able to craft Leafsung Ink in Mama Tree. (Don't waste any of your winnings on the Leafsung Vial Creation in Mama Tree at present, if you haven't yet.)
  - Fifth: You'll need bunches of Leafsung Ink for a later sidequest with a far niftier reward. Don't burn yourself out farming that now, if you haven't checked out Balance yet.
  - **Fifth and a half**: Golden Chests and River Chests just started dropping Leafsung Ink. I'm not completely rewriting this section the way I possibly should in light of this, because this means that fighting Arenica and Suulan and Desert Rudakai just became relevant to this quest, as well as * spoiler * in the Floating City of Balance. 
  - **Fifth and three quarters**: Look, just ignore the rest and come back after you've gotten far enough through Balance to find a consistent source of River Chests and River Keys, because you might just want to farm all your Leafsung Ink that way.
  - Sixth: Spider Poison will be the most demanding thing to farm, if you decide to manufacture Leafsung Ink the old-fashioned way, because you absolutely cannot get it except from a battle or a Luciola Wooden Chest. (Essence, Leaves, and Steel Bars will probably be the next-most-demanding bits). Spider Poison is best gotten from Aracni in Luciola Forest, but Illi in Mama Tree and Ylly in Gansu will give you Rope at the same time (needed for a lot of other things in the game) and some much-needed variety. Illi stack well with Tylu, which will get you Claws for the Leafsung Ink. Ylly will also help you gather Raw Fabric.
  - Seventh: So, the Steel Bars. Yasri in 3PC drop them directly, and also drop Fine Fabric that you'll need, and extra Raw Steel to help polish off. If you get tired of them, Rulo drop Raw Steel in nice quantities.
  - Eighth: Essence and Leaves can come from Desert Wignow, which conveniently also drop the Desert Stones that are in such high demand for Gansu sidequests.
  - Good luck, and may the Force be with you.

### Steel (Or Brace) Yourself - Balance

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Unlocked by:** Riza MQ6/Journey Upriver
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 5 Reinforced Steel Helmets and 5 Reinforced Steel Breastplates
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest and 1 River Key
- **Recommendations:** Not now. For one, you'll definitely want to equip yourself with the first R.S. Helmet and Breastplate you can get, so you functionally need 6 of each. For another, 1 River Chest and 1 River Key are nowhere near as valuable as the items you're trading for them. But when you're running out of sidequests, this is a fun one to try to push through.

### Steel Weapons - Riza

- **Location:** Riza Rivertown
- **Unlocked by:** Riza MQ3/Remedy for a Friend
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Craft & turn in 5 Steel Maces and 10 Steel Shields
- **Rewards:** 3 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** Biggest resource suck up to this point in the game. Even for completionists, I'd wait until all Main Quests were finished before tackling this one. Probably most of the sidequests, too. Much better to craft a Steel Mace to use yourself.

- **Requirements:** Defeat 30 Nuig
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: River Grass Skirt
- **Recommendations:** On one hand: that's a lot of Nuig, and a lot of Water Masks to battle them. On the other hand: that is a lovely skirt. Consider picking up this one at the same time as Elemental Powers and Venomous Villains and the start of Main Quest 3, and then you can knock out 30 Nuig and never touch them again.

These are the kind of long-term battle quests that are worth saving to go in the background while you're collecting five billion Spider Poison for another quest.

### Venomous Villains - Balance

- **Location:** Floating City of Balance
- **Unlocked by:** Balance MQ1/ Help From A Master
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 7 Nuig, 7 Aracnu, 7 Ylly, and 7 Sparfly
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest and 1 River Key
- **Recommendations:** Again, for those counting at home, this is a minimum of 3 Areas in 3 Regions (Nuig available only in Balance, Ylly only in Gansu in the Desert, and Aracnu only in Luciola in the Forest; Sparfly might as well be picked up in Gansu while you're there). Which makes it pair really well with Elemental Powers, which also involves a lot of travel and Nuig. Don't forget to consider Nuig-heavy Stingy Surprise and Main Quest 3 at the same time. And while you're traveling, consider those 5 Lorsa Nests for the Scouting Lorsa quest.

### Water Tribe Member - Riza

- **Location:** Riza Rivertown
- **Unlocked by:** Gansu MQ8/Dust to Dust
- **Type:** Forum
- **Requirements:** Make 100 Forum posts
- **Rewards:** 15 Core Crystals
- **Recommendations:** DO IT. It will take approximately FOREVER. (Good news: you don't have to keep it in your Questbook. It counts all the forum posts you've ever made, no matter how many times you drop the quest while you're doing it.) Then you'll get to know everyone in the forums, which is fun! So yes, do it, but don't worry about officially picking it up except when you want to check how close you are to turning it in.
