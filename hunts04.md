LAST UPDATED 27 FEB 2021

Season 3 started blurring the lines of where the Seasons take place (after all, the Van- monsters popped up all over the game to drop Hunter Tokens). Season 4 is ranging all over right from the start. Sure, most of the miscellaneous quests take place in the Dust Region, but Dust Velts isn't in the Dust, the first presumable-Assistant type is deep in the Forest... it's a time to wander everywhere and explore everything!

## Season 4 Quests - The Main Line

### Something Extraordinary

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: A Bubble Dream
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Mirdor
- **Rewards:** Hunt Map Piece 10 and 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** The description for this quest will outright tell you that Mirdor is in Guardian's Lair. The Bard seems to be all over the game!

### Ideas Brought to Life

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: A Bubble Dream
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Weekiwa
- **Rewards:** Hunt Map Piece 11, 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** You know the drill. Weekiwa is clearly a water entity, so my subtle hint dovetails with the quest description to point you to look in water communities.

### Dirt to Dust

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: A Bubble Dream
- **Type:** Streak, Collection
- **Requirements:** Have Hunt Map Piece 10 and attain 5-day Streak
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Golden Brooch https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;652-hunt-golden-brooch-3827-31075.png
- **Recommendations:** What's to lose by picking it up? And it lets you continue with the Hunt!

### Celebrate Joy

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS4 Quest: Dirt to Dust
- **Type:** Streak, Collection
- **Requirements:** Have Hunt Map Piece 11 and attain 7-day Streak
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Facepaint Eye Stroke https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm_666-hunt-facepaint-eye-stroke-4035-59139.png 
- **Recommendations:** We're continuing on, and we're gonna make it. Almost to the end of the Hunt Map Piece collecting/turning in!

###Still Missing Something

- **Unlocked by:**  HuntS4 Quest: Celebrate Joy
- **Type:** Streak, Collection
- **Requirements:** Attain 10-day Streak, deliver all 11 Hunt Map Pieces
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Map Hands https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;872-hunt-map-hands-6024-61497.png
- **Recommendations:**  This unlocks the Bard and the end of the first year of the Hunt! Alas, it will take all your Hunt Map Pieces away (or "hurrah", if you were weirded out by that huge chunk in your inventory), but at least you'll have a Map in hand.

###Proving Your Friendship

- **Unlocked by:**  HuntS4 Quest: Still Missing Something
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat the Bard 4 times
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Bard's Pet https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm_1502-ferret-pet-10188-43895.png
- **Recommendations:**  It's the capstone of the first year of the Hunt! Complete and celebrate your completion!

## Season 4 Quests - Singing Sideline

### Sing Your Enthusiasm

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: A Bubble Dream
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Zanthei
- **Rewards:** 20 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** I think Team Zanthei is getting a shoutout here! If you pick this up while Zanthei is dropping Hunter Tokens, those tokens will add up to effectively triple the reward on this quest.

### Sing Your Bravery (2/2)

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS4 Quest: Sing Your Enthusiasm
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Cursed Hands
- **Rewards:** 15 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** If you don't know what Cursed Hands are, you may need to finish Dark Forest Outpost and go on to the Purple Gate. Otherwise, no recs!

###Sing Your Commitment (3/4)

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS4 Quest: Sing Your Bravery (2/2)
- **Type:** Streak
- **Requirements:** Attain a 15-day Streak
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  It's a bit tedious. But the satisfaction of cleaning out this chain...

###Sing Your Wander (4/4)

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS4 Quest: Sing Your Commitment (3/4)
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each: Wignow, Desert Wignow, Dust Wignow, Spirit Wignow, and Swamp Wignow
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Facepaint Around Eye https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;660-hunt-facepaint-around-eye-3951-47167.png
- **Recommendations:**  See what else you can get going for you while you're on this one. It involves a fair amount of travel, although 160 Coins will pay for you to make a one-way trip across the Valley, and 320 will pay for a round trip, so this might be worth shelling out for.

## Season 4 Quests - Miscellaneous

###A Battle of Celebration

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: A Bubble Dream
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Morimet
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:**  Right now, this doesn't look like it actually does anything, since we have all the Hunt Map Pieces in hand; we'll see if that holds true once the Bard appears!

### Cheer Your Dedication

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: A Bubble Dream
- **Type:** Wordcount, Forum
- **Requirements:** Write 10,000 words and make 5 posts in the Forum
- **Rewards:** 15 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** I always recommend participating in the forum, and the 10K will happen as you go. Take it!

### Into the Woods

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: A Bubble Dream
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Molox, 4 Osalyu, 10 Spirit Ardia, 1 Lycosta, 1 Chaensi
- **Rewards:** 50 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** A very challenging quest, which I completed for completionism's sake alone. This dovetails with multiple Dark Forest Outpost quests, but otherwise, there's no rush to grab it.

### Jubilant and Strong

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: A Bubble Dream
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 100 of any monster
- **Rewards:** 50 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Look! 50 Hunter Tokens for taking up a quest spot while you're doing other things! Not a bad deal... also easy to pick up later, if you'd rather. :)

### On the Wrong Path

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: A Bubble Dream
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Infected Golem
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** This one requires monsters from midway through the Purple Gate, and it's entirely optional for progressing the Hunt. (It also dovetails with at least one PG quest.)

###Stories to Tell

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: A Bubble Dream
- **Type:** Wordcount
- **Requirements:** Write 25K Words
- **Rewards:** 25 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** I am never one to turn down wordcount quests, because you can always add to them while you're doing other things.

### To Celebrate and Share

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: A Bubble Dream
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 6 Takori
- **Rewards:** 20 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** I'm not sure what Takori have to do with celebration (unless we're celebrating escaping them?), but hey, ours is not to question why, right?

###Celebrate Stories

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS4 Quest: Still Missing Something
- **Type:** Wordcount
- **Requirements:** Write 5000 words
- **Rewards:** 10 Core Crystals, 10 Reactions: Celebrate, 10 Reactions: For The Valley!
- **Recommendations:**  10 CORE CRYSTALS. FOR 5K WORDS. GET. THIS. NOW.
