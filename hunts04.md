LAST UPDATED 25 SEPT 2020

Season 3 started blurring the lines of where the Seasons take place (after all, the Van- monsters popped up all over the game to drop Hunter Tokens). Season 4 is ranging all over right from the start. Sure, most of the miscellaneous quests take place in the Dust Region, but Dust Velts isn't in the Dust, the first presumable-Assistant type is deep in the Forest... it's a time to wander everywhere and explore everything!

## Season 4 Quests - The Main Line

### Something Extraordinary

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: A Bubble Dream
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Mirdor
- **Rewards:** Hunt Map Piece 10 and 10 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** The description for this quest will outright tell you that Mirdor is in Guardian's Lair. The Bard seems to be all over the game!

### Dirt to Dust

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: A Bubble Dream
- **Type:** Streak, Collection
- **Requirements:** Have Hunt Map Piece 10 and attain 5-day Streak
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Golden Brooch https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;652-hunt-golden-brooch-3827-31075.png
- **Recommendations:** What's to lose by picking it up? And it lets you continue with the Hunt!

### Cheer Your Dedication

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: A Bubble Dream
- **Type:** Wordcount, Forum
- **Requirements:** Write 10,000 words and make 5 posts in the Forum
- **Rewards:** 15 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** I always recommend participating in the forum, and the 10K will happen as you go. Take it!

### Sing Your Enthusiasm

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: A Bubble Dream
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Zanthei
- **Rewards:** 20 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** I think Team Zanthei is getting a shoutout here! If you pick this up while Zanthei is dropping Hunter Tokens, those tokens will add up to effectively triple the reward on this quest.

### To Celebrate and Share

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: A Bubble Dream
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 6 Takori
- **Rewards:** 20 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** I'm not sure what Takori have to do with celebration (unless we're celebrating escaping them?), but hey, ours is not to question why, right?

### Into the Woods

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: A Bubble Dream
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Molox, 4 Osalyu, 10 Spirit Ardia, 1 Lycosta, 1 Chaensi
- **Rewards:** 50 Hunter Tokens
- **Recommendations:** A very challenging quest, which I completed for completionism's sake alone. This dovetails with multiple Dark Forest Outpost quests, but otherwise, there's no rush to grab it.

## Season 4 Quests - Miscellaneous

### A Battle of Evolution 4/4

- **Unlocked by:** HuntS3 Quest: Battle of Constitution
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Velts: Dust
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Hunt Battle Helmet https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;634-hunt-battle-helment-3693-42038.png (7 variants)
- **Recommendations:** Shockingly, Dust Velts is to be found in the Water Region, possibly enjoying DÃ­ at Luko's Inn. As far as I can tell, this is the end of the quest chain, but this Velts has particularly nice drops (especially if you've recently opened Raina, or really any area beyond Riza). And once again, even though I divide these Velts quests into Seasons, you can complete them all while still being in Season 1.
