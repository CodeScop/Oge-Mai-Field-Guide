### New Hunt Monsters: Late Jul 2020

I'm rethinking the statement that last month had no new S3 monsters. Vanstra emerged last month in MT, and this month Vanspi has shown up in 3PC. Still, they're available without unlocking the Hunt; I'll still refrain from listing them as Hunt monsters for now.

- Velts: Water

Same as the rest of the month; we're waiting to switch the token drops till the Meteoroid event ends Aug 4. I'll update with the August tokens then.

# Early August 2020

The Hunter Token monsters finally switched on August 4. 

**Early Aug 2020 Sources Outside the Hunt:**

August 2020 sources are Hunt monsters and monsters with wings/flight. **NOTE FOR DOUBLE TOKEN WEEK:** **Some of these do not double.** I suspect that fractional math is involved for some that are already generous without being doubled. So far, Spirit Wignow, Spirit Castu, and Ardia are the undoubled ones. Also, Buholi in Tall Trees is being weird as of this writing.

- Global Battles: Vi (1-4 for 5 minutes), Viyu (3-14 for 15 minutes), Viyusa (5-20 for 25 minutes), Xin (100 words for 1)
- LF Battles: Reenu (200 words for 2), Spirit Wignow (450 words for 4-5), Pester (500 words for 5), Nitana (700 words for 7)

  - BC Battles: Sacer (120 words for 1)
  - FB Battles: Ardia (50 words for 1), Ardii (60 words for 1), Ardis (70 words for 1), Spirit Ardia (80 words for 1)
