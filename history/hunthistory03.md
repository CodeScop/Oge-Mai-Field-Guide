### New Hunt Monsters: Late Jul 2020

I'm rethinking the statement that last month had no new S3 monsters. Vanstra emerged last month in MT, and this month Vanspi has shown up in 3PC. Still, they're available without unlocking the Hunt; I'll still refrain from listing them as Hunt monsters for now.
