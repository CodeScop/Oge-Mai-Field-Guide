LAST UPDATED 31 MAR 2020

The Hunt for the Ancients started in January 2020, and it's been a RIDE since. I'm starting this section in March, as it begins to make less sense to keep the Field Guide info separated by time, but I still want to be able to keep track of how things shift and change.

# Early March 2020

March 2020 is when the release date moved from the 4th of the month to the 24th; they decided to have two March releases instead of a long wait between Hunt phases.

This was the first time that Joining the Hunt was released, and it caused a bit of confusion for people who wondered where the Hunt monsters had gone, especially since anyone who had completed Elder Library Assistants could see the Elder Library's Security quest.

# Late March 2020

March 24 brought about the close of Season 1, plus a global event to unlock the ability to unlock Season 2. (I'm hesitant to say that the global event unlocked Season 2 by itself, because when the event was over, Season 2 was unlocked ONLY for those who had already completed the late-March-release quest The Curator of Elder Library.)

###Raising The Curator Of Elder Library (Special Event)

> Community Objectives: Words of Hope 4 million
>
> Dust Warriors,
>
> Our Ancient of Hope, the Curator of Elder Library, has been found! 
>
> We need the community’s help to prove to them that our community is ready for the ancients to return to Oge-Mai Valley. We must embody the spirit of hope and write! Write your stories, write your struggles, write your worlds, write your hopes and dreams, write, so that the Curator of Elder Library will stay with us!
>
> We have a “hope bar” we’re tracking on the site, and when enough words have been written the Ancient of Hope will return to Oge-Mai Valley.

(Note: The Curator was available for anyone who had unlocked it even before this community goal was achieved. The real thing unlocked by this event was Season 2, which became available about 44 hours after the global event started.)

### New S1 Quests: Late Mar 2020

- Curator's Family
- The Curator of Elder Library
- (See S2 for S2 quests)

### New S1 Hunt Monsters: Late Mar 2020

- Curator of Elder Library
- (See S2 for S2 monsters)

### New S1 Resources: Late Mar 2020

None. Although S2 introduced its own thing...

### Hunter Token Sources: Late Mar 2020

The Hunter Token monster didn't switch over until S2 released, so I'm going to count that as an S2 thing.

### New Wardrobe Items: Late Mar 2020

Again, new Wardrobe didn't appear until S2 unlocked, so I'm counting that as part of S2.
