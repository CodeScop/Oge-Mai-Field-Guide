LAST UPDATED 27 FEB 2021

Year 2, Season 1 introduced House Items to us (well, House Items beyond the three that appeared almost a year before Houses did: Hunt Altar, Monument, and Shrine). We are again in the Season of Hope, and quests seem to be mostly unlocked via the capstone of last year's Season of Hope, and much less direction-oriented. Seem. Look, I'm making this history as it happens, there's only so much I can do. Hence I'm calling this Season 1.2.
