LAST UPDATED 9 DEC 2020

Lookit what I didn't do, apart from getting a list of what items COULD be obtained through Sky Tournament monsters and quests! (Well, obtained or used. Poor Leaves and Wood, only spent, not earned.) Maybe someday this will update. Maybe. Meanwhile, you can do the math by looking through the monsters and quests if you're really curious.
