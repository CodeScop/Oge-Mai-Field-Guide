LAST UPDATED 9 DEC 2020

Welcome to the ~~(first ever)~~ 44th Annual Sky Tournament! This was the year I decided that the best way to avoid a nervous breakdown was not to update the Guide live, and instead just live my life. The wiki took over beautifully: https://4thewords.fandom.com/wiki/Sky_Tournament

But my inner historian will not be soothed without having this info in the historical section one day, so I'm going to go ahead and try to maintain enough notes to fill in the Historical Survey when this is all done. Not, mind you, that I will guarantee that I WILL do all the cross-referencing to build all the info that I usually do, but the raw data will all be there, and maybe get cross-referenced someday.

First, the timeline (many thanks to the wiki for starting me off, and many thanks to the 4tw staff for announcing a clear outline in advance so we could follow: https://4thewords.com/forum/details-304 )

Inaugural Ceremony - October 30th

-  Introduced Alkonis, Harka, and Liski as global monsters and a global quest: Alkonis's Inaugural Quest

Kalakun releases Tempest Bats - October 31st

-  In violation of the rules, Kalakun released Rocego all over the valley. Nabia suggested a new quest to clear out the bats.
-  A Halloween quest: Orange and Black was released as a global quest.

Meet the Clouds Team - November 1st

-  Clouds Area opened with 9 quests and 6 new cloud creatures. Alkonis, Harka, and Liski retreat from being global monsters to being Cloud-only monsters, while Kalakun and Rocego disappear. Alkonis's Inaugural Quest and Orange and Black disappear. Note that the latter was live on the site for less than 24 hours (midday Halloween Costa Rica time til early morning 1 Nov Costa Rica time); we received promises that it would reappear later. Alkonis's Inaugural Quest got no such promises, but at some point reappeared in the Clouds area. Event monsters disappear from global areas.

Meet the Dawn Team - November 5th

-  Dawn Area opened with 4 quests and 7 dawn creatures

Meet the Tempest Team - November 10th

-  Tempest Area opened with 4 quests and 8 tempest creatures, along with reintroducing the Black and Orange quest in the Dawn area.

Gratitude Journal - November 12th

-  A new, global gratitude Journal quest was released.  Dust  warriors had to make 4 forum posts, and it was recommended that these be in the Gratitude Journal thread.  On January 20th, there will be a raffle invloving everyone who made at least 4 posts in the Gratitude Journal thread, with three prizes of 150 Core Crystals and one prize of 150 Core Crystals and a year of subscription time.
-  Desktop Backgrounds and Monster Cards were made available for download .  The monster cards could be printed out, shuffled up, then used to determine which monster to fight next.
-  The developers gave 5 stempos to every dust warrior who wrote a single word over the last 6 months.   This was because the last year has been difficult and the devs wanted to give dust warriors a mental health reprieve if they needed it.

Tournament Semi-Final: Clouds vs Dawn - November 15th

- The competition begins! Players can help a team by fighting monsters from the opposition to gain points (1 point per 10 words), or "heal damage" to their own team (10 Sky Tokens to buy a Health Pack that heals 1000 words/removes 100 points from the opposition)
- Devs caught someone helping Team Clouds in wildly disproportionate fashion (buying 750 health packs at once, which would have meant battling 750,000 words' worth of Sky monsters in the past 15 days and spending not a bit elsewhere) and had to work to balance the damage. New code goes into place limiting individual impact on global events when ridiculous amounts are involved.
- Dawn and Clouds are neck and neck until Dawn is JUST ahead at the finish line on November 17.

Tournament Final: Tempest vs Semi-Final Winner -  November 21st

- This time, the dynamics are the same, but the Healing Packs are now available for both teams globally at the "Healing Station" instead of being available only in the home zone of the team they're healing.

End of Tournament - November 23rd

- Dawn wins! Alkonis crafts the Cloud Wignow, Dawn Wignow, and Tempest Wignow to celebrate the end of the tournament; each is released in its own area, and each area gets a quest to fight 5 of them in exchange for a wardrobe item and 15 Sky Tokens. The shop releases its legacy wardrobe items: a medal for each of the teams, at 4 Sky Tokens apiece.

Hunt & Sky Gala - November 24th

- The next chapter of the Hunt for the Ancients opens, and we get our crystal-purchaseable wardrobe drops!

Gala Celebration and Sky Parade - November 26th

- What it looks like. We have a lovely parade and wrap up any quests we hadn't finished until the Tournament went away on Dec 4 at 10 AM Costa Rica time. Which was an extension on the promised Dec 3 end date, whee!
