LAST UPDATED 9 DEC 2020

Alas, another thing I didn't have time/energy to track, and this I seriously doubt I'll go back and redo. I can, at least, list out what was available in the various stores, and you can look back at the quests to see what could be earned that way.

###Global

(Global-ish, more precisely. During the Clouds vs Dawn semifinal, you could purchase Clouds Health Packs in the Clouds area and Dawn Health Packs in the Dawn area. People decided this was inconvenient, since Clouds partisans would be battling Dawn monsters and vice versa, and so during the finals, Health Packs popped up in their own little Town Store in every area in the game.)
