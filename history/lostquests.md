Here today, gone tomorrow... quests don't change often in the main game, but they do change.

This section is purely for quests which used to exist and have since been deleted.

## Three Points Crossing

### Extra Repairs

Noticed missing: January 2020

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Three Points Crossing
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Collect 20 Stone Blocks, 30 Rope, 15 Sandstone Blocks, 25 Wood, 10 Steel Bars
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Desert Pants
- **Recommendations:** â€¦ I really, really love these Desert Pants, and so I prioritized getting them, and for me it was totally worth it. If you're less concerned with your avatar's fashion, this quest is on the expensive side and has no other benefit. Unless you have a ton of Wooden Chests and Keys, or love fighting Yasri to bits, remember that you'll need an additional 30 Wood to make the Steel Bars, that you'll need to fight a lot of Rulo for the Stone Blocks and other Stone, and you might need up to an additional 35 Rope to craft all the Stone and Sandstone Blocks.
