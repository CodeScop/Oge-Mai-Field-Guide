###List of Kirala-Defined Phases For This Event:

- Endgame: Jul 31-Aug 3: I'm anticipating and writing this on July 31, that we're entering the final phase of the game. I think it's a pretty safe bet. Enjoy cleaning up the last of the remains!
- Giant Zanutaki: Jul 24 - 31: Nothing good came of mixing Zanthei, Nuig, Tambo, and Kiru. Now we need to defeat an Abomination of Science.
- Large Experiment: Jul 21- Jul 24: I see nothing good coming from mixing Tambo, Kiru, Nuig, and Zanthei. We'll see what happens.
- Preparing For Large Experiment: Jul 20-21: This is going to be very short, and it's mostly a chance to play around with the new quest involving the matchup results.
- Experiment: Sassi v Lubu: Jul 17-20: I find Xomri a little disturbing, but hey. Next experiment is cats and dogs and WHAT'S NEXT, because this is the last Experiment of its kind...
- Experiment: Lombri v Xin: Jul 14-17: Sulanica is AMAZING. Let's see what happens with Lombri and Xin. (ClouDragon has an excellent artist's rendering of a possible result halfway down this page: https://4thewords.com/forum/thread/guessing-the-next-match-up)
- Experiment: Arenica v Suulan: Jul 11-14: Voting by battle again! Mowow is the result of Maesc & Wignow, and now the Arenica Hologram and Suulan Hologram are dropping the same as other holograms
- Experiment: Wignow v Maesc: Jul 8-11: We're voting by battle! There are holograms of the Wignow and Maesc in the Research Lab for us to fight. Drops are identical; the only difference is which you want more of in the hybrid result!
- Spaceship Arrives: Jul 4-8: We've built the landing pad! Two days to enjoy the fruits of our labor, and then a few days to build the Research Lab as a community.
- Opening Phase: Jul 1-4: event opens up, and we're waiting for the alien landing pad to be built!

## Quick Quests To Pick Up ASAP List:

I'm adjusting this on the basis of "it's the last weekend, what do you NOT want to miss?"

### Impact Crater

- **Aid the Wordsmith**: A series which depends on wordcount; might as well have it going on in the background!

### Mining Site

- **Every Day Battling**: A streak quest which is good to have in the background

### Research Lab

- **Projecting Light:** HOLOGRAM. PET. We have been promised that we will have the opportunity to finish this quest and fight these monsters at some point after the event ends. That doesn't stop me from wanting it NOW.

# New This Phase:

Nothing but the shiny new Wardrobe item, so I'm retiring the "new this phase" section as we wrap up the event. :)
