## All Quests: Impact Crater

### A Happy Prickle

- **Location:** Impact Crater
- **Unlocked by:** Opening Phase
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 20 Maesc
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Crystal Eyebrows https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;898-crystal-eyebrows-6270-64179.png and 25 Fleet Lab Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Up to you! Not something I'd necessarily prioritize, but it's a nice little quest.

### Rock To Dust

- **Location:** Impact Crater
- **Unlocked by:** Opening Phase
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Erbor
- **Rewards:** 25 Fleet Lab Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Pretty easy for you to make up your own mind on this! A 400-word monster x 4 for 25 Fleet Lab Tokens (plus the 16 you'll get in battles)... that's not shabby. Especially since Erbor drop Dinti, too.

### One Rocky Start

- **Location:** Impact Crater
- **Unlocked by:** Opening Phase
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each:
  - Kolbs
  - Nartha
  - Oxie
  - Krang
  - Rhan
  - Ipo
  - Erbor
  - Arir
  - Halix
  - Maesc
  - Brachi
  - Calatre
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe x2: Halix Hat https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;883-snail-hat-6150-16248.png and Golden Shield https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;gold&#95;shield&#95;4thewords.png
- **Recommendations:** Pick it up and carry it as far as you can. You want to battle all the monsters for the event anyway, right? Especially since these are the easy ones.

### Aid the Wordsmith (Fleet Cadet 1/5)

- **Location:** Impact Crater
- **Unlocked by:** Opening Phase
- **Type:** Wordcount
- **Requirements:** Write 10K words
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Space Bodysuit Purple https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;space&#95;bodysuit&#95;purple.png
- **Recommendations:** This quest chain ultimately adds up to 250K words (with the bulk of the rewards on the regular NaNo end of things). Try to keep on top of this chain, picking up the next and turning it in as quickly as possible. And remember, any words you've already written that day count for the quest you pick up - which is to say, Muisje had 25K words written in one day, and then kept picking up and turning in these quests in succession. People writing at a sane pace won't have so many words to count twice, but every little bit helps.
