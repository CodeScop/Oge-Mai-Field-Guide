LAST UPDATED 27 DEC 2019

The SHRINE! This is a weird, shifting place, where everything can change in a moment.

I'm listing info in order of stability, which feels like an act of hubris when it's shifted every week or two for a month and will likely change again. The Quests so far are stable; the Monsters available via Easter Egg have increased on occasion. The Shrine Stone Store has gained and lost items available, and the Resources have changed.

**BE AWARE THAT THIS AREA HAS NO GUARANTEES.**

I usually try to be very strictly accurate in my Guide, but the Shrine changes more quickly than I can guarantee accuracy. Uurwall Tentacle monsters started out dropping Shrine Stones and switched to Coins, went from reliably one Coin every time to shifting between one and four...

These are best guesses.

For latest best guesses, check out the forum thread: https://4thewords.com/forum/thread-shrine-of-ages-spoilers

(And THANK YOU SO MUCH to the many, many people in that thread who have helped me find info I otherwise couldn't.)

## Quests

### From The Beginning (1/4)

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Shrine of Ages
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** defeat 1 "4 Wignow" (quotes mine to make it clear that 4 Wignow is the name of the monster!)
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Key, unlock Time And Place 2/4
- **Recommendations:** The quest wording gives you the broad hint: your avatar needs to be wearing the right item to make the 4 Wignow appear. If that's not enough hint for you, scroll down to the Monsters to see what the exact item is.

### Time And Place (2/4)

- **Unlocked by:** From The Beginning 1/4
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 of each of the three colors of Uurwall Tentacle
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Chest, unlock The Write Stuff 3/4
- **Recommendations:** This is going to take a minimum half a week, since it takes a full week for the Uurwall Tentacle color cycle to complete. Only one's ever available at a time. But since the yellow is available the longest (from Saturday to Monday), you'll get through the quest faster if you keep the yellow on one end. (Start on Monday or Wednesday for the shortest quest cycle.)

### The Write Stuff (3/4)

- **Unlocked by:** Time And Place 2/4
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Have ≥ 5 Leafsung Ink in Inventory
- **Rewards:** 1 Stone Key
- **Recommendations:** YOU GET TO KEEP THE LEAFSUNG INK! YOU GET TO KEEP IT! And then you're free to use it for another quest as desired.

### Shrine Mission Accomplished (4/4)

- **Unlocked by:** The Write Stuff 3/4
- **Type:** Battle, Wordcount
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Desert Wignow & write ≥444 words while wearing the Desert Facemask
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest
- **Recommendations:** As of this writing, the Desert Facemask is only necessary at the point you turn the quest in, but it's more fun to pretend you need to wear it the whole time. And also as of this writing, yes, you need to leave the Shrine to fight those Desert Wignow. Maybe go down to Gansu and spend the Stone Chests and Keys you've earned from the earlier parts of the quest sequence.

Yes, there are other resources! Starting with those universally available from Xin and Awa! However, I'm not going to maintain my usual detailed cross-reference for this.
