LAST UPDATED 10 MAR 2020

NOTE: Ordinarily I try to be comprehensive in my Resource Guides. Here, I'm going to list ONLY item info either available/used in Raina, or available/used in Riza and possibly worth keeping in mind while in Raina. Go back to the Riza Resources or peek ahead to the Water Region resources if necessary; most Raina quests will need the Desert and Forest Resources a lot more than anything local.
