So, you're done with Riza Rivertown's Main Quests. Maybe you've opened Raina Surface Camp, maybe you're headed straight to Balance. If you're headed straight to Balance, go ahead and skip ahead! This is the region of convoluted sidequests, and that might not be your cup of tea. (Remember, you have to complete the Special Mini-Area Quest: Raina Surface Camp in Riza Rivertown before you can unlock this region.)

But you, dear reader, are still reading. So I assume you're willing to stick with it. Bravo! May I strongly recommend looking up a grinding resource assistant of some kind. I've mentioned these at the start, but you may need a reminder now.

@mbrennan (https://4thewords.com/about-mbrennan) has an excellent resource calculation spreadsheet here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13ys7Dm3RcsRdYwOTqT0H5HzPTHEBBIIpFhXwwfSWcQM/edit?usp=sharing and a forum thread to discuss it here: https://4thewords.com/forum/thread-return-of-the-resource-calculation-spreadsheet

I've got a Grinding Resource Assistant here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SLw9tWHg8S445-vpFRE4t-21fha6qgPsZtBoco0zV9I/edit?usp=drive&#95;web&ouid=110256490236397847938

Both these are public Google Docs where you can download a copy and figure out what you need when .

**A nice bonus of Raina Surface Camp:** Knusha and Yala are cheaper to battle here than in Riza. Yala are, in fact, free here. I think it's the only point in the game where a monster in a later area has *easier* requirements than the same monster in an earlier area.
