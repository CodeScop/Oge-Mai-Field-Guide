squirenonny has done some experimenting and figured out a few more details about how the endurance monsters work https://4thewords.com/forum/thread-endurance-monster-tips-viviyuviyusa which I'm reproducing here for your convenience. Though I hope to explore further soon!

-------------

Since a few people were asking about it and I had some extra time, I  experimented with the Vs (Vi, Viyu, Viyusa) a little bit tonight and put together some tips for people wanting to battle them but not quite sure how--or for people who want to get the most out of the fights. Spoiler: They're all potentially the BEST source of Fleet Tokens in the game.

###How Do Endurance Battles Work?

- There is no set word count for Endurance Monsters. Instead, there's a timer,  and the goal is to keep writing for the entire time. (5 minutes for Vi,  15 for Viyu, and 25 for Viyusa.)
- Each of these monsters has a  base health of 30 HP, with one additional point awarded for each point  of Defense. 0 Def=30 HP, 10 Def=40 HP, ect. Attack and Luck don't matter in these battles, so if you want a less intimidating fight, change up  your gear to put as many points in Defense as you can.
- Health  goes down at a rate of approximately 1 HP every 2 seconds. Due to  refresh rates and lag, mine only changes every ~4 seconds, and there's  about a 4 second lag. I.e. I stop typing, and my health stays where it  is for 4 seconds before it stops dropping. It often drops one more time  after I start typing again before it starts to rise.



### What is the light green section of the health bar?

- That's the bonus zone.
- The bonus zone starts at approximately 75% of total health.
- This means that boosting your Defense gives you a larger buffer if you're a slower typist or need time to think.
- (Note: Numbers are approximate because it's hard to measure these things and  type at the same time lol.) At 0 DEF, it has 30 health. You need to  maintain approx. 23 HP to stay in the bonus area. That means you have a  maximum of 14 seconds of no typing, starting from full HP. At 10 DEF, it has 40 health, you need to maintain 30, you have 20 seconds leeway. At  25 DEF, it has 55 health, you need to maintain 42, you have 26 seconds  leeway. At 50 DEF, it has 80 health, you need to maintain 60, you have  40 seconds leeway.
- **tl;dr: Higher Defense means more time to think.**
- Note: It's really hard to tell how quickly the gauge fills back up, so I  can't tell you how fast you have to be typing to maintain full  health/increase your health after it's dropped. Ballpark estimate based  on my attempt to maintain the hp in the dark green range below the bonus level without going higher or lower? 2-3 characters per second keeps  you even. So odds are if you're typing words, you're going to be  increasing your health by at least a little.
- The game seems not  to always count spaces as characters (at least based on nonsense typing; 2+ character nonsense words worked better than one character-one space  alternation.)



###What does the bonus multiplier do, and how do I get it?

- As far as I can tell, the bonus multiplier is based purely on what percentage of the time you spend in the bonus range.
- **You hit 2x multiplier if you spend about 1/3 of the battle in that range,**
- **You hit 3x at 2/3 of the battle,**
- **And you hit 4x at 90% of the battle in the bonus range.**
- For Vi, that means 4 and a half minutes in the top range to get the 4x  multiplier. For Viyusa, it's 22 and a half. You have a little more  wiggle room, but you need to maintain your writing pace for longer.  Depends on your style whether the big ones are harder or easier.
- Bonus multipliers are literally multipliers for the drops. Vi at no bonus  gives you 10xp, 1 token, and 3 coins. At 4x, it gives you 40xp, 4 tokens and 12 coins.
- I've hit 4x multiplier on Vi with as little as  252 words; I was in bonus range for about 20 seconds longer than I  needed to be and spent most of the battle at full health, so you can  definitely hit 4x with fewer words, as long as you're typing at a slow  and steady pace. 200 words is not out of the question, making 1 token:50 words a distinct possibility here. I almost hit that rate on Viyusa  (1:56 with 1343 words) so I know it's also possible on the larger  monsters.
- **Vi has a base drop of 1 Fleet Token; Viyu 3 Tokens, and Viyusa 6. Meaning at 4x multiplier, they drop 4, 12, and  24, respectively.**
- That makes it easily the best source of Fleet Tokens in the game if you're able to reach that 4x bonus multiplier and aren't *so* incredibly fast that you're flying way past my averages. If you're beating Vi with 400 battle words (battle words meaning you account for your Atk  multiplier); Viyu with 1200 battle words, and Viyusa with 2400, you're  not getting any more out of the Vs than regular monsters. If you're way  above that, you're actually being LESS efficient by fighting the Vs.
