## Mining Site Quests

### A Miner Problem

- **Recommendations:** Decide how much you like the stylish Miner Hat. You know you want it. Also, it's impossible to see Pach if you don't have it, and that means the Seeing the Unseen quest will be impossible till this quest is complete.

### An Explosive Personality!

- **Unlocked by:** Event Benchmark: Mining Site Cleared
- **Location:** Alien Meteoroid: Mining Site
- **Type:** Streak, Collection
- **Requirements:** Reach 10 Streak Days in a row, deliver 10 Dinti
- **Rewards:** Miner Hat, 25 Fleet Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Pick up if you have space, just to accumulate streak days. The Miner Hat has better Luck than any other equippable headgear in the game right now; go look up the stats in the Resources if you want more details. Not a bad perk.

- **Recommendations:** I can't resist Dinti shinies, but it's understandable if some people have other reactions.  No need waste a quest slot on it till you have it completed, and bear in mind that We Will Rock You and Love Rocks'n'Roll will both accrue Dinti while you complete them.

### Here's My Reaction (1/4)

- **Unlocked by:** Event Benchmark: Mining Site Cleared
- **Location:** Alien Meteoroid: Mining Site
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Rist

### Here's My Reaction (2/4)

- **Recommendations:** Remember that although you picked this up in the Mining Site, Gwynos is back over in Impact Crater.

### Here's My Reaction (3/4)

- **Unlocked by:** Here's My Reaction (2/4)
- **Location:** Alien Meteoroid: Mining Site
- **Type:** Battle

### Here's My Reaction (4/4)

- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Nium

### Love Rocks 'n' Roll

- **Unlocked by:** Event Benchmark: Mining Site Cleared
- **Location:** Alien Meteoroid: Mining Site

- **Recommendations:** Even if you don't love the rewards, consider whether you want to farm Dinti for something else and whether this quest might be a fun way to do it.

### Robot Fight Club

- **Unlocked by:** Event Benchmark: Mining Site Cleared
- **Location:** Alien Meteoroid: Mining Site
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 2 Jeso, 3 Deepo, and 4 Ferenti
- **Rewards:** Robot Torso
- **Recommendations:** ~~As of this writing, there's no reason to hurry to pick this up unless you're fighting Jeso for another reason and want to avoid double-fighting. I'm watching this closely, though, because if the Robot Torso is equippable, it could add some badly-needed diversity to the Chest items.~~ It has a Chest item as a reward, and the only Chest item I've ever seen that has a Luck stat greater than zero. \*drools\*

### Seeing The Unseen

- **Unlocked by:** Event Benchmark: Prepare Spaceship For Launch
- **Location:** Alien Meteoroid: Mining Site
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Pach
- **Rewards:** 5 Dinti & 10 Fleet Tokens
- **Recommendations:** There's a hidden prerequisite for this: the quest A Miner Problem, because your avatar has to be wearing the mining hat from that quest for Pach to appear (they're in the Mining Site when they do). That done, it's a simple quest to pass the time.

### We Will Rock You!

- **Unlocked by:** Event Benchmark: Mining Site Cleared
- **Location:** Alien Meteoroid: Mining Site
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Fin
- **Rewards:** 25 Fleet Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Up to you! A lot depends on whether you like Fin. If you're hunting Dinti, though, remember that this will accrue Dinti as you go.

## Spaceship Quests

### 30 Days of Data

- **Unlocked by:** Event Benchmark: Crash Landing
- **Location:** Alien Meteoroid: Spaceship
- **Type:** Streak
- **Requirements:** Reach 30 Streak Days in a row
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Brain Hair https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;brain&#95;hair&#95;lighthing.png
- **Recommendations:** Pick up immediately, if you have any interest at all in doing it. That way it can wrap up by the end of NaNo.

- **Recommendations:** This quest chain ultimately adds up to 100K words (with the bulk of the rewards on the regular NaNo end of things). Try to keep on top of this chain, picking up the next and turning it in as quickly as possible. And remember, any words you've already written that day count for the quest you pick up - which is to say, Muisje had 25K words written in one day, and then kept picking up and turning in these quests in succession. People writing at a sane pace won't have so many words to count twice, but every little bit helps.

- **Requirements:** Deliver 10 Leaves, 10 Dust, 1 Reenu Wings, and 1 Fur
- **Rewards:** 10 Fleet Tokens
