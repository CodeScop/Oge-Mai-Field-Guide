LAST UPDATED 20 DEC 2019 (to consolidate 30 Nov and 6 Dec versions)

Welcome, welcome, to NaNoWriMo 2019: Something Strange in Our Skies! This event pleasantly surprised us by opening early. Hurrah!

I'm going to do my best to keep this updated, but it's a scramble. **Watch this space for updates to organization and info.**

**New November 15:** We have our first wardrobe-linked monster! The quest reward for A Miner Problem in the Mining Site will, when worn, reveal a new monster in the Mining Site area. **Please feel free to tag me if you notice any more of these**, because I will certainly not catch everyting on my own.

**New November 17:** The unlocking of Finoir means the Fin- quest sequence is open. See the Spaceship Wardrobe section for all the different color options!!! And Captain Piak has been released, so now we can FINALLY complete Mad Scientist's Prescription!

**New November 22:** Piachi taking over!

**New November 29:** Piachi have been safely confined to the Mining Site, but the Arir bugs have swarmed the Meteoroid areas.

LAST UPDATED 6 DEC 2019

*starts whistling "Taps"* That's it for the main event, folks. The Meteoroid is no longer accessible; all its quests and monsters are out of reach.

But let's face it, the rock monsters are basically part of the event too. So I'm going to keep a version of this section up until after this weekend.

For the sake of simplicity, though, I'm removing all the parts we can't access anymore. So if this section gets noticeably narrower, well, you'll know why.

And if you want to see What It Used To Be...             https://4thewords.com/read-oge-mai-historical-survey-by-kirala there's a thing for that!
