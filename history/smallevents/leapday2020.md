LAST UPDATED 29 FEB 2020

Leap day event! We started with all the quests, plus the Rescue Baby Ducks Global Challenge where we had to collectively beat 1000 of each of the baby ducks in order to unlock Idaa and Natida.

That did not take long.

**I only have two recommendations for this event:**

**1) Make sure you've picked up all the quests before starting any of them** (or at least, make sure you have Lining Up Ducks going in the background while you work on one of the other two.)

**2) Queue.** I am a fairly slow writer normally, so I was worried about being able to complete all 2925 battle words in 44 hours minus the crowded weekend ahead of me. Then I realized that if I can beat just 3 Tian - just 300 words, minus my Attack impact - while having all the quests sitting in my questbook, I could queue everything else I need to take care of the rest of the week. So fear not, slower completionists! This is possible for anyone who can manage even one day of hitting the minimum streak amount.
