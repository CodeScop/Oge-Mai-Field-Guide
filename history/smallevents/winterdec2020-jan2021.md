LAST UPDATED 6 JAN 2021

Okay! I'm getting back in the saddle! Nevermind that this event started way back on December 18, and now it's January 6 - I'll at least get this up in time to add to the archives!

Also, a quick moment for whole-event recommendations: it's possible, if you have a very busy day, to complete all these quests in 7000 battle words. If you are a mere mortal doing your best, but at least make sure all available quests are in your questbook at the same time, it'll take you 11000 battle words to clean out the quests. Forget to overlap, it's 13000. 

Prioritize the chain quests, so as to unlock the third before the event ends, queue the monsters, and you'll be able to complete at leisure. The Scarf Garlands will only do you any good right now, though, and it'll take about 10K battle words to get all the wardrobe and reactions, even if you don't care about the 8.5K battle words required to get a mere one each of the token-purchasable house items.

So, without further ado:
