LAST UPDATED 16 FEB 2021

Welcome to the... (checks past News items) fifth? annual Love Week event! (Look, there's a news post announcing it in 2017 and nothing earlier, I'm making an educated guess here.) Enjoy the New And Improved Love Xin, which now drop Wood and Leaves instead of Dust! Enjoy the Love Arrows! Enjoy the itty-bitty details here and there!

As usual with less-than-monthlong-events, the monsters are everywhere and the quests are in the Global part of every single Town; tokens (in this case Love Arrows) may be spent at the Love Festival Token Store in Luciola Forest for the duration of the event (although if you want to chime in to request an extension, there's a campaign going on here: https://4thewords.com/forum/thread/keep-the-event-stores-open-a-few-days-past-the-event)

My main rec? **Focus on picking up Rhythm of My Heart.** It's the quest you'll most regret waiting to pick up. I'm particularly fond of the **Gratitude Journal** and the **Etta's Present questline** as well...

## Quests

###Bundle of Roses

- **Location:** Global
- **Unlocked by:** Event Open
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Love Wignow
- **Rewards:** 15 Love Arrows and Wardrobe: Love Wignow Hair https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1566-love-wignow-hair-10997-57412.png
- **Recommendations:**  I'm particularly fond of this hair, but it is the only variant, so if it's not to your taste, decide if the 15 Love Arrows (plus 50 from the battles) are worth your effort.

###Flying Hearts Attack!

- **Location:** Global
- **Unlocked by:** Event Open
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Love Frizi and 5 Love Pester
- **Rewards:** 15 Love Arrows and Wardrobe: Love Ear Muffs https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1566-love-wignow-hair-10997-57412.png
- **Recommendations:**  You can probably gauge a lot of the importance on your own, but for what it's worth, these do come in 5 colors (well, five colors for the actual muffs; there's no changing the arrow or headband): red, white, bright purple, yellow, and hot pink. Man, I miss Lisa Frank.

###Gratitude Journal: Love Edition

- **Location:** Global

However, if you want a shot at the 150-Crystal prize, you need to make a minimum of 4 posts in the appropriate Gratitude Journal thread (more gives you more chances to win). So head on over and check it out! https://4thewords.com/forum/thread/gratitude-journal-love-edition

(Look, I know these recs are really all about the wardrobe, but I think the events are self-explanatory these days; why not focus on the unknown??)
