LAST UPDATED 20 DEC 2019

Y'all, this may be the cutest event I've ever seen, just on account of I get to buy snowball reactions to fight people in the Forums. And if you start now, it's around 700 words/day (or less, depending on your Attack) to beat all the quests. I'm in love.

So, first the Quests, then the Monsters, then the Snowball details, skipping other resources because you can see them well enough on the Monster section, and also because Things You Can Buy With Snowballs segues well into Here Are All The Wardrobe Items.

##Quests
