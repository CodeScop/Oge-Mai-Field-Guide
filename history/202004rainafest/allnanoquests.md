## Pick Up Immediately

### Gratitude Journal - Swamp Edition

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Raina Sacred Site
- **Location:** Raina Surface Camp (note: NOT Raina Sacred Site)
- **Type:** Streak, Forum
- **Requirements:** Maintain a 44-day Streak, post 4 messages to the Forum
- **Rewards:** 44 Reactions: Grateful, 4 Core Crystals
- **Recommendations:** Gratitude journal quests are good reminders to perform gratitude; I would go for it. If you make at least 4 gratitude posts in the correct Forum thread ( https://4thewords.com/forum/thread-gratitude-journal-swamp-edition ), you enter a drawing to win 150 Core Crystals.

### 10 to 10K

- **Unlocked by:** Global Event Opening: Expedition Through The Swamplands
- **Location:** Swamplands
- **Type:** Battle, Wordcount, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat any 10 creatures, reach 10,000 words, get 10 Swamp Moss
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Raina Stone Necklace https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;723-raina-stone-necklace-4744-55409.png
- **Recommendations:** **This should be prioritized if you like the reward, because this necklace will NOT be available, at all, ever, after this event.** And this dovetails really well with the Crying Larida Tears, since that will get you halfway to finishing this one. And, of course, Wading Through and Onwards, which is nice to try to complete at the same time.

### New Family of Friends

- **Unlocked by:** Opening of Raina River Festival
- **Location:** Raina Surface Camp
- **Type:** Wordcount, Streak
- **Requirements:** Attain 5-day streak 
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Algae Shirt https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;704-algae-top-4588-11016.png
- **Recommendations:** Pick this up immediately as you have nothing to lose.

- **Recommendations:** There's no rush to complete this quest, but it'll more or less finish itself in the background if you pick it up immediately.

### Wading Through & Onwards

- **Unlocked by:** Global Event Opening: Expedition Through The Swamplands
- **Location:** Swamplands
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each:

- **Location:** Raina Sacred Site
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each: Cafodu, Wisthu, Grongu, Drau

- **Recommendations:** If you've completed Learning Defensive Measures in the Surface Camp, you're halfway there. And that's a shiny flask. And these monsters drop good loot. I'm not really seeing a downside...

## As You Please

### Crying Larida Tears

- **Unlocked by:** Global Event Opening: Expedition Through The Swamplands
- **Location:** Swamplands
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Larida
- **Rewards:** 25 Raina Festival Tokens
- **Recommendations:** This dovetails really well with the 10 to 10K quest - unless things go horribly wrong, you'll get the Swamp Moss you need and a nice chunk of the battles and wordcount in. And, of course, Wading Through and Onwards, which is nice to try to complete at the same time.

### Learning Defensive Measures

- **Unlocked by:** Global Event Opening: Rebel Raina Attack The Festival!
- **Location:** Raina Surface Camp
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Cafodu and 1 Drau
- **Rewards:** 20 Raina Festival Tokens
- **Recommendations:** As I write this, there's a global event that wants you to fight these guys anyway. Go ahead and help out the community and yourself at the same time! Bearing in mind that the monsters drop Raina Festival Tokens as well, that nets you 48 total. Which is not a bad bargain.

### Let's Play A Game

- **Unlocked by:** Opening of Raina River Festival
- **Location:** Raina Surface Camp
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Vaktra
- **Rewards:** 15 Raina Festival Tokens
- **Recommendations:** A tidy little quest, depending on how much you enjoy fighting 700-word Vaktra. Good for filling in the cracks when you're tired of intense ones.

### Feed or Teach?

- **Unlocked by:** Opening of Raina River Festival
- **Location:** Raina Surface Camp
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Droxa and 5 Auwi
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Algae Bracelet https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;718-algae-bracelet-4706-29321.png
- **Recommendations:** Just a little too big to be called "little", it's still a nice side quest without a ton of intensity.

### Ecstatic Endless Energy

- **Unlocked by:** Opening of Raina River Festival
- **Location:** Raina Surface Camp
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Begala
- **Rewards:** 15 Raina Festival Tokens
- **Recommendations:** Those little Begala go down quickly, and by the time you're done with this quest, you'll have earned 45 Raina Festival Tokens - enough to get quite a few goodies!

### Siege of Soldiers

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Raina Sacred Site
- **Location:** Raina Sacred Site
- **Type:** Streak, Wordcount, Battle
- **Requirements:** Maintain 5-day Streak, write 5K words, defeat 5 Kuldoro and 5 Ognimaf
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Magic Flask https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;707-magic-flask-4614-99965.png (7 colors - black, blue, white, purple, red, yellow, green)
- **Recommendations:** This is pretty low-key, all things considered. I'd pick it up pretty quickly. Even if you write the minimum for a streak, it's easy to finish within a couple weeks.

### Quest for the Gold Frog

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Raina Sacred Site
- **Location:** Raina Sacred Site
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 25 Kuldoro
- **Rewards:** 25 Raina Festival Tokens
- **Recommendations:** 2500 battle words for 25 (actually 50, including battle wins) Raina Festival Tokens. I know *I* have items worth buying that way. (Plus, they're cute.)
