LAST UPDATED 24 APR 2020

Welcome to the Raina River Festival!

Here's where I'm putting all the info pertinent to the festival.

**NOTE on April 24:** It's looking like the event changes may be done. (Watch me have to swallow my words later!) But the event MAY be staying static until it closes on May 4. I'll keep an eye out (and I'll change this note first if anything changes, so you can know I've noticed), but meanwhile I'm focused on updating the Hunt for the Ancients. :)

**IF YOU HAVE NOT YET COMPLETED RIZA RIVERTOWN'S MAIN QUESTS:**  some of these dovetail really well. Not "woe is me, there is no way I can do it and it will double my work" really well, just "ooh, that's a nice little overlap" well. Consider paying attention to both.

Also, a lot of these resources are really valuable in the Water Region, and a lot are really good to sell for cash. I will not distinguish between them here, you can see my opinions in the Water Resources, but just so you know there's a mix.

And here we go!
