# BASE CAMP SIDEQUESTS

### A Darkened Forest

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Base Camp
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Min Level 3, 25 Dust, 3 Leaf Boots, 5 Rope
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest and 1 Wooden Key
- **Recommendations:** As you please. Pretty obvious what the costs/benefits are.

### Hard Day's Walk

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Base Camp
- **Type:** Battle, Streak
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Kaija, 1 Xuso, and 1 Sacer; have minimum 3-day Streak when you turn in
- **Rewards:** Unlock Forward Base area
- **Recommendations:** Did you not see? Unlock Forward Base. DO IT!

### Nabia's Exploration

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Base Camp
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Sacer, 1 Kaija, 1 Nezthai, 1 Xuso, 1 Ardia, 1 Sapilo, 1 Sapira, 1 Sapiti, 1 Buholi, 1 Buhini, 1 Buhovi, 1 Ardii, 1 Ardis
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Expedition Hat  https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;explorers&#95;hat.png
- **Recommendations:** Absolutely do it. Nothing to lose, pretty pretty quest.

### One Hundred Creatures

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Base Camp
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 100 monsters of any kind
- **Rewards:** 5 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** Always good to have running in the background. It'll fill up without you having to pay any attention, and Stempos are nice to have.

### Just a Mean Green

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Base Camp
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 25 Xuso
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Xuso Necklace https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;974-xuso-necklace-7085-57599.png
- **Recommendations:** There seems to be a new theme of a necklace in each Expedition area, and I heartily approve. Xuso drop a lot of good basics, too.

# FORWARD BASE SIDEQUESTS

### Feeding the Lighthouse

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Forward Base
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 25 Ardia, 25 Ardii, and 25 Ardis
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest, 1 Ardi Lamp
- **Recommendations:** Well, you can't advance until you complete this, anyway. Plus, Ardi* beasts are fun to battle.

### ** Javelin Toss West

- **Unlocked by:** Feeding the Lighthouse
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 10 Ardi Lamps
- **Rewards:** Unlock Tall Trees area
- **Recommendations:** If you're trying to beat Tinkering with Leafsung, right beyond this quest is where you get Buhini. But you'll want to have some Nezthai Claws and streak days under your belt before you can get much further than opening this up.

### ** North: Homeward Bound

- **Unlocked by:** Feeding the Lighthouse
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 15 Ardi Lamps
- **Rewards:** Unlock Guardian's Lair area
- **Recommendations:** If you want to find Night Dandeleons and their pretty crowns, make sure you stop by here. Plus, completionists need this.

### ** Stone's Throw East

- **Unlocked by:** Feeding the Lighthouse
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 10 Ardi Lamps
- **Rewards:** Unlock Stone City area
- **Recommendations:** If you're on a roll, prioritize this one: the region has some quests that are nice to collect early and have in the background while you're opening up.

### Blossom with Flowers! (1/2)

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Forward Base
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Dandeleon (220 words in 30 min)
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Key
- **Recommendations:** Go for it! It's fun! It's easy! It's on the path to a nice crown!

### Lovely Flower Crown

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Forward Base
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 15 Dandeleon Flowers & 10 Saliva Vials
- **Rewards:** 3 Wooden Chests & 3 Wooden Keys
- **Recommendations:** I would leave this one for a while personally - Saliva Vials are much more useful to hoard until you've cleaned out Stone City, and Dandeleon Flowers will tend to build up in the background no matter what you're doing. But odds are that by the time you're doing a second pass of the Forest Expedition, this will be an easy win.

### To Collect Memories

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Forward Base
- **Type:** Wordcount, Streak
- **Requirements:** Write 10000 words, attain 10-day Streak
- **Rewards:** 5 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** 5 Stempos are not to be sneezed at, and the wordcount part takes care of itself. 

### Lighting the Way

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Forward Base
- **Type:** Collection, Battle
- **Requirements:** Deliver 25 Dust and 10 Wood, defeat 5 Ardia
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Key, opening Ardi-beasts in Mama Tree
- **Recommendations:** Up to you. Pretty straightforward!

### Sturdy Wooden Fence

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Forward Base
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 25 Wood and 15 Rope
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest
- **Recommendations:** If you've been playing long enough to get this far, you don't need my recommendation. Obvious tradeoffs. I wouldn't do this without having at least 10x the needed amount on hand, personally - the resources are too valuable.



# STONE CITY SIDEQUESTS

### A Forest Riddle

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Stone City
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 50 monsters of any kind
- **Rewards:** 3 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** Grab it! Nothing to lose! It's great to have in the background!

### Scouting The Land

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Stone City
- **Type:** Words, Streak, Battle
- **Requirements:** Write 3,000 words, maintain a 3-day streak AFTER picking up quest, defeat 1 Sapilo, 1 Sapira, and 1 Sapiti 
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest
- **Recommendations:** I like the Sapi-beasts because they drop Spider Poison, and the other requirements aren't too irksome. This is a quick quest on the battle side, so why not?

### Nothing But Trouble

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Stone City
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 2 Sapilo, 2 Sapira, and 2 Sapiti, and deliver 6 Vine Nets and 15 Rope
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest & 1 Wooden Key
- **Recommendations:** I mentioned I like Sapi-beasts, right? But at this point in the game, I personally have hundreds of Vine Nets and can spare a few. They might be pricier to you. Bear in mind that the Vine Nets tend to be easiest to get from Mama Tree Wooden Chests.

### Slowest Tortoise Wins

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Stone City
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 12 Reudod
- **Rewards:** 2 Wooden Chests & 2 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** A very nice reward, but I admit I'm partial to these tortoises and I like an excuse to fight them.

### Sleepless in Stone City

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Stone City
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 8 Sapilo & 8 Oncaiii
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Sapiemon Necklace https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;979-monkey-necklace-7096-75774.png
- **Recommendations:** It's a little pricey, once you factor in the invisible Kaija costs, but it is a lovely necklace and they are fun beasties to battle.

### Stone City Chaos

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Stone City
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 each Sapilo, Sapira, Sapiti, and Reudod
- **Rewards:** 4 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** I hope you're looking for overlap, because this quest overlaps with pretty much every other quest in Stone City. If you haven't gotten far in the Desert yet, the Stempos are irresistibly available here. Look! Ways to pause your streak!

# Tall Trees Sidequests

### Boots Made For Climbing

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Tall Trees
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Buholi, 1 Buhini, and 1 Buhovi; deliver 25 Leaves and 1 Leafsung Boots
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest, 1 Wooden Key, 1 Stempo
- **Recommendations:** Leafsung Boots are awfully valuable things to lose. But this is a pretty nice reward, especially if you don't have any Stempos yet.

### Scouting the Trees

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Tall Trees
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 Buholi, 1 Buhini, and 1 Buhovi; deliver 3 Vine Nets and 12 Rope
- **Rewards:** 1 Golden Chest
- **Recommendations:** If you're doing Boots Made for Climbing, might as well double-dip. Watch the Vine Net and Rope levels, though; they become very important later in the game, and you don't want to wear yourself out getting them.

### Trying Your Patience

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Tall Trees
- **Type:** Streak
- **Requirements:** Maintain a 10-day Streak
- **Rewards:** 3 Wooden Keys
- **Recommendations:** Unless you need space in your Questbook, what's to lose by keeping this?

### Swing, Sway, Summon

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Tall Trees
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Deliver 25 Feathers
- **Rewards:** 1 Wooden Chest, 1 Wooden Key
- **Recommendations:** I would pick this up when you have 25 Feathers to spare. (And by this point, you'll be able to guess when you have 25 Feathers to spare.) I would not put myself out grinding Feathers at this point.

### Buholi in the Sky

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Tall Trees
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Buholi
- **Rewards:** 4 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** Notice that the requirements don't mention that you'll need to beat 2-3 Nezthai for every Buholi you want to fight. Pace yourself.

# GUARDIAN'S LAIR SIDEQUESTS

### Bright Night Blossoms (2/2)

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Guardian's Lair
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Night Dandeleons (and already have Blossom With Flowers from Forward Base completed)
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Dandeleon Crown
- **Recommendations:** It's a cute crown and they're cute monsters! Who only come out at night. ("Night" apparently starts at 18:00 where I am; I'm not sure how much of that calculates Daylight Savings or not. From others, I suspect it's 19:00 without Daylight Savings.)

### Shadows In Flux

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Guardian's Lair
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Gobkeys
- **Rewards:** 3 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** TAKE IT. The Stempos are an outstanding reward for 2K words of writing, and you'll want the Gobkey's drops if you ever want to see the Shrine of Ages.

### Eat the Leaves?

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Guardian's Lair
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Maikile & 10 Wignow
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Leaf Necklace https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;1010-leaf-necklace-7448-12835.png
- **Recommendations:** As this quest unlocks, I'm a long, long way past my first time in the Forest. And this quest makes me nostalgic for that time. So I'm biased in its favor. Objectively, it's worth as much as you like that Leaf Necklace (and multitasking on Wignow quests, if you have any left).
