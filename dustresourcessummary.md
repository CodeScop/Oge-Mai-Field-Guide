LAST UPDATED 22 APR 2021

I was of two minds opening this section, given that the Dust summary is similar to the All Game - but then I decided that narrowing this down to "resources available in the Dust Region without traveling" might be a useful thing. And of course "resources NOT available in the Dust Region, but you'll need them, and here's where you might have forgotten them".

NOTE: I am counting EVERYTHING from the Hunt Season 4 as part of Dust, to help bring it to your attention if you'd miss it otherwise.

**Oge-Mai Forest, Expedition Forest**

FOREST

- GL = Guardian's Lair (one Hunt monster there)

**Oge-Mai Desert, Expedition Alien Meteoroid, Expedition Desert**

DESERT

**Oge-Mai Water, Expedition Raina**

WATER

- Riza = Riza Rivertown (one Hunt monster there)

**Hunt for the Ancients**

- HuntS1 = Hunt for the Ancients Season 1
- HuntS1.2 = Hunt for the Ancients Season 1 Part 2
- HuntS2 = Hunt for the Ancients Season 2
- HuntS3 = Hunt for the Ancients Season 3
- HuntS4 = Hunt for the Ancients Season 4

**Oge-Mai Dust**

- DFO: Dark Forest Outpost
- PG: Purple Gate
- CAVE: Cave (I tried a less dramatic abbreviation, but it's hard to tell that that's an abbreviation.)
