### Note on the Vi-Beasts

Vi, Viyu, and Viyusa are Endurance Monsters. This means that you beat them by typing continuously (more or less) for the allotted time. Don't worry about being a fast typist; you can take it slow on them. Just don't STOP too long to think.

If you stock up on Defense equipment, you have more of a cushion to think. And if you type VERY steadily and keep in the bright green zone of the health indicator, you can win bonuses that multiply your rewards.
