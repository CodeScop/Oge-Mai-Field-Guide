LAST UPDATED 2 APR 2020

This started out as a simple guide. The idea was that you jump in at whatever point in the game you were at, read any advice that you wanted to, and jump ahead. Meanwhile, you could always go back to the the big Resource section, or ahead to the end, and get a quick recap of what you'd seen or missed in prior areas.

That... sort of still works.

### If you're new to the game...

The earlier parts of the Guide still work pretty well on this level. If you're starting Luciola Forest, start with the Luciola Forest Intro. If you're ready to move into Mama Tree, maybe skim the Luciola Forest Summary before moving on to the Mama Tree Intro. Near the end of every Summary section, I have a list of all Resources available up to that point (anything that might get into the inventory), and for every Resource, I list all the sources (with better sources separated on top) and all the uses and what I recommend selling/keeping. I also have recommendations on sidequests, if you're trying to figure out how to prioritize.

## The guide to the Guide

**How my organization is working currently, from Oge-Mai Valley to the Hunt for the Ancients to the Expedition to the Shrine of Ages, with Special Events and whole-game Summary.**

Thing is, since I started the Guide, the game has gotten more complicated, and there's only so much I can do to keep up. When I started in spring of 2019, the game was more or less straightforward: you advanced from one Area of **Oge-Mai Valley** to the next as you followed the Main Quests, and you did whatever sidequests you wanted on the way and wandered back to old Areas for Resources. Areas, then as now, were grouped into Regions (Forest, Desert, Water, and Dust so far) which had free travel with each other. Now and again, you'd have a **Special Event** which either acted like its own special Area or offered a scattering of monsters throughout the game. I wrote advice and recorded useful data based on where the game progressed, with a big summary at the end, so that detailed info on monsters, resources, and quests was available to everyone without spoiling the later game.

Three big complications have been added to the game since then: the **Expedition Areas**, the **Shrine of Ages**, and the **Hunt for the Ancients**. The Expedition Areas are areas to explore off the beaten path, and take a break from the Main Quests. They're slowly being added to every Region. Deep in the Desert Expedition, the Shrine of Ages is a special Area where you can, if you've saved up the right resources, get a ticket back in time to play monsters and quests from old events. Meanwhile, the Hunt for the Ancients runs almost in parallel to the Main Quests in a kind of hybrid between the regular game and a Special Event.  The Hunt runs through the Oge-Mai Valley and Expedition areas, starting in Luciola Forest and moving onward. These three parts are much less linear; it's a lot harder to decide what should or should not constitute a spoiler. (On the other hand, you're much less likely to get stuck and unable to go anywhere else if something goes wrong here.)

## Oge-Mai Valley

Each Area of Oge-Mai is split into two overarching sections: Intro and Summary. (Sadly, these sections are the same thing as chapters; if we ever get the ability to group chapters into sections, I'll be breaking these down in a heartbeat.) The Intro section is designed to be read/examined as you enter an Area; the Summary is designed to be read/examined when you're ready to move on. Here's what you'll find:

### [Area] Intro

- **Intro:** Intro and general advice upon entering an area. Also likely to be opinionated.
- **Sidequests:** A quick list of all sidequests available when you enter, together with recommendations about which ones to prioritize and which ones might be better off waiting to complete. More opinions!
- **Monsters:** A quick list of all monsters available in the area, what they require, and what they drop.
- **Main Quests:** Going through the main quests in sequence with tips on how to complete them

### [Area] Summary

- **Sidequests:** Listing all the sidequests available when you leave, together with a few more recommendations (and any sidequests unlocked by those sidequests, so you can see what's there)
- **Monsters:** This time, instead of just telling you WHAT the monsters drop, I tell you HOW MUCH they're likely to drop, the better to help with farming resources. Also, we're adding in any monsters unlocked going through the area.
- **Resources:** This gets included in the Summary about half the time: if this is the only Area you've unlocked in the Region, I summarize all the resources available in the Area with at least some reference to all the resources in the game so far. If this is the last Area, I save the Resource Summary thing for the Region summary, because it'd basically be the same info twice.
- **Battle Gear:** This isn't consistent as I write this intro, but a lot of the earlier areas have a special Battle Gear section that repeats ONLY info about Resources which can be equipped and improve your stats, so you can compare what's available.
- **List of Available Quests:** This lists nothing but the names of the quests... with indents to (hopefully) make it clear which quests unlock/are unlocked by other quests vs. which quests are standalone

### Region Resources

This is a recap at the end of each Region, and it is nothing but a long list of **ALL the resources available in a region,** **Oge-Mai Areas and Expedition Areas alike**, including how you can get them in battles, as quest rewards, as chest drops, how you buy them, how you craft them, how you use them, whether you can afford to sell them... and, in later regions, it will also list the name of resources available only in older regions and let you know which region has the detailed info.

(And some of these will also have a full list of Battle Gear, but again, inconsistent as of this writing.)

###Region Bestiary

Can't remember what Area had that monster? Check out the Region Bestiary! All the info on monsters from the Area Summary, plus a code to tell you every location they appear at in the game so far, PLUS a list of all quests so far featuring the monster. **(Note that if you have picked up multiple quests requiring you to battle a monster, every battle you win counts toward ALL those quests. It's efficient to dovetail those quests as much as possible.)**

## Expedition Areas

After you've finished all the Main Quests in a Region (or the Main Quests in the first Area of the Region, as of now in the Water Region), a brand-new sidequest will pop up giving you the chance to unlock the Expedition for the Region.

I recommend NOT using the Guide for these, unless you're in a hurry. Until you get to the Dust Region deep in the game, they're entirely optional for the Main Quests, and it's more fun to explore them on your own.

But if you need something in particular and don't want to skip to the whole-game summary, I have the following available:

### Expedition Intro

An introduction to the ENTIRE Expedition for the Region. There are multiple Expedition Areas in most Regions, and you can skip ahead to the Travel Directions at the end of the Guide if you want to know how to unlock them in sequence, but again, I think it's more fun to just wander around Expedition.

### Monsters: Expedition

I list all the monsters, Area by Area, that are available in this Expedition Region. Expedition Areas tend to be much smaller and simpler than Oge-Mai Areas, and they can take the compression.

### Quests: Expedition

Same as with the monsters, I list the quests Area by Area. There is no Main Quest to follow here; they're all sidequests!

### Resources

For Expedition, I'm much, much more terse on resources. I list ONLY resources which are available in that particular Region's Expedition, with very little other indication - I figure you can go back to the Oge-Mai references to figure out where/how to farm resources if necessary. Also, Expedition is usually after all the Oge-Mai Areas for the Region - which means that if you're willing to be spoiled for Expedition info, you're probably just as well off investigating the Region Summary info.

### List of Available Quests

Because it makes life simpler. Same as at the end of the other Areas: a list of the quests by name only, indented to show which quests unlock/are unlocked by others.

## Hunt for the Ancients

Quick link to the Official Explanation: https://4thewords.com/page/hunt-for-the-ancients

The Hunt for the Ancients launches in Luciola Forest, and so I've got my Hunt Intro nested in between the Intro and Summary for Luciola Forest, but that's not where most of the info is.

The Hunt is parallel to the main game so far, with each "Season" taking place in a different Region of the game (despite the fact that all quests and rewards are based in Luciola Forest). Since you have to unlock an entire Region to complete all the Hunt material for a season, I'm nestling the Hunt Season summary right before the Region summary.

### Hunt: Season [Number] - [what it's Season Of] ([REGION])

- **Quests:** This will be organized according to What Makes Sense to me in a very fluid and interconnected web of work. There may be multiple Quest sections, so that the info is subdivided.
- **Hunt-Specific Season [X] Monsters:** Listing the monster and location for every monster unlocked by the Hunt
- **Hunt-Specific Resources:** Things which will be added to your Inventory by the Hunt, and ONLY by the Hunt. (So far, this is Hunter Tokens and Hunt Map Pieces.)
- **Hunt Questline** To help you organize the quests.

## The Shrine of Ages

Whew. The Shrine of Ages.

This is a very special area, where it starts out looking empty and ends up looking insanely full.

The Shrine of Ages equips with entirely different monsters, quests, and wardrobe items depending on what you choose (I'm being vague here to avoid spoilers, but I'm clear when the Guide gets there.) For right now, I have each "event" listed separately in alphabetical order. So the "Shrine Event" part recurses a bit.

### Shrine Intro

Self-explanatory.

### [Shrine Event]

These are basically organized

- **Quests - [Event]**
- **Monsters - [Event]**
- **Resources - [Event]**

###Shrine Wardrobe

ALL Wardrobe items available in the Shrine of Ages.

## All Of The Above

After all the Regions have been covered, Hunt and Expedition and Shrine and all, I have my section for ALL THE INFO, for quick reference for those who've either opened up the entire game or who don't mind the possibility of spoilers.

Incidentally, the Resources section is over 16K words right now, not counting the Streak and Level info.

### All Resources & Streak Rewards

Has all the resources in the game, their sources, their prices, their uses, etc,  followed by a list of rewards reached when you reach a certain streak or level.

###All Battle Gear & All Wardrobe

Want to narrow down your Resources to just things that equip? That's the point of All Battle Gear. Want to know where every single wardrobe item in the game is, and what it looks like? All Wardrobe has you covered.

### All Game Bestiary & All Quests

Here's where I list every monster, its location, what quests are needed... everything. And the All Quests is a quick bullet-point list of all the quests in the game, so you can see what unlocks/is unlocked by other things.

### Travel Directions

For if you just want to know what quests to complete in order to open up a certain area.

## Special Events

For any current special events, I'll try to keep up with quests, monsters, and resources worth noting, and often wardrobe as well. But that will vary, and I'll explain in the Special Events section itself.

## State of the Guide

Every time I make a change to the Guide that's more substantial than a two-minute fix, I'll add a new post to the top of this section detailing what I'm doing and why. You can scan down to see how things change! I'll also post in the forum:

**This is the best way to let me know any corrections/requests as well.**

# And in the end...

Feel free to ignore everything! This is for you to use or ignore as you prefer!
