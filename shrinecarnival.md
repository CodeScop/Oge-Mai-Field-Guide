# Quests - Carnival

NOTE: Once you complete a quest, it's removed from these offerings. So if you have completed a quest in a prior event, it won't be available here.

### Fighters, Friends, Foes

- **Unlocked by:** Wardrobe: Carnival Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 2 Fetezira
- **Rewards:** 20 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** None needed! Pretty straightforward.

### Cut the Strings

- **Unlocked by:** Wardrobe: Carnival Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Roica and 2 Biironk
- **Rewards:** 15 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** Possibly the easiest quest in this event.

### Tears and Feathers

- **Unlocked by:** Wardrobe: Carnival Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Halores
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Carnival Mask https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;646-carnival-mask-3781-45288.png
- **Recommendations:** I happen to adore the mask and recommend going for this as a priority. It does have only the one variant, so it's not like there's a chance of getting a different one you like better, but... fun! Also, I like all the Carnival monsters, so fighting 5 Halores is an appealing prospect.

### Peace and Sunflowers

- **Unlocked by:** Wardrobe: Carnival Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 2 Mahor
- **Rewards:** 30 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** Exactly what it looks like. And Mahor maintains a NaNo pace (one Mahor at zero attack will equal 1/30 of 50K), so it's nice for checking progress on that front.

### A Carnival Festival

- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each:
  - Upuchu
  - Thapiolo
  - Mahor
