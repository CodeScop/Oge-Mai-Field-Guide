LAST UPDATED 12 SEPT 2020

Welcome to TeaCo Week, a continuation of the proud 4TW tradition of celebrating Costa Rican Independence Day (September 15) with a weeklong Tico-themed festival. (And a very happy Independence Day to the Costa Rican portion of our wonderful dev team!) I confess to being very happy with the "tea" theme this year, contrasting with the usual focus on coffee. (What can I say, I prefer hot leaf juice to hot bean juice.)

As with all small events, the monsters and quests are EVERYWHERE, so no need to travel to enjoy them. The Festival Rewards token store is set up in Luciola Forest, however, so if you want to spend your TeaCo Bouquets on wardrobe items, you'll need to travel to LF.

And if you want the deets, https://4thewords.com/community/globalevent has all the details you may need.

Here's what I've got!
