# Quests - Colorful Ooze

NOTE: Once you complete a quest, it's removed from these offerings. So if you have completed a quest in a prior event, it won't be available here.

### Green Be Gone!

- **Unlocked by:** Wardrobe: Colorful Ooze Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each:
  - Afeppti
  - Crilum
  - Eguley
  - Elobre
  - Fraite
  - Kenkom
  - Lekhop
  - Otpar
  - Roaki
  - Sothai
  - Spodo
  - Zainga
- **Rewards:** 50 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** Obviously you pick this up immediately so that you can double up any other quests. It's not quite as intimidating as it looks: there might be a dozen monsters, but they're mostly quite tiny.

### Cute Confetti Cannons!

- **Unlocked by:** Wardrobe: Colorful Ooze Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 4 Afeppti
- **Rewards:** 25 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** They really are cute confetti cannons, aren't they? Up to you how interested you are!

### Gather Lucky Stars

- **Unlocked by:** Wardrobe: Colorful Ooze Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Sothai
- **Rewards:** 15 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** I have a weakness for Sothai purely because the original event had a pretty wardrobe reward attached to Sothai battles. But objectively, this is... another quest! Decide what you want to do with it!
