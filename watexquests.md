#RAINA SURFACE CAMP SIDEQUESTS

### Energy Now, Tired Later

- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Begala and 10 Rea &Pira
- **Rewards:** Unlock Swamplands, Wardrobe: Golden Nose Piercing https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;780-golden-nose-piercing-5300-55800.png
- **Recommendations:** This is what unlocks the next area in Raina Expedition; I'd go for it.

### Sans the Bone

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Raina Surface Camp
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Auwi
- **Rewards:** 3 River Water and Wardrobe: Bone Nose Piercing https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;719-bone-nose-piercing-4712-76828.png
- **Recommendations:** This is great if you're trying to make some more DÃ­ Bags, since you get not only the reward River Water but also the River Water dropped by the Auwi on the way. Otherwise, up to you.

### Defeating a Droxa Drove

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Raina Surface Camp
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 Droxa
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest, Wardrobe: Raina Gold Necklace https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;722-raina-gold-necklace-4742-87811.png
- **Recommendations:** I like the Raina Gold Necklace, personally, and a River Chest is always nice, and the Droxa make me feel rich. Go for it!

### Stamina Level Up!

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Raina Surface Camp
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 15 Vaktra
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest & Wardrobe: Moss Hat https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;727-moss-hat-4772-99897.png
- **Recommendations:** Up to you! No secret ins or outs here.

### New Family of Friends

NOTE: This exact quest was offered during the Raina Festival in April 2020; if you completed it then, it will not be available now.

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Raina Surface Camp
- **Location:** Raina Surface Camp
- **Type:** Wordcount, Streak
- **Requirements:** Attain 5-day streak 
- **Rewards:** 1 River Chest & Wardrobe: Algae Shirt https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;704-algae-top-4588-11016.png
- **Recommendations:** Pick this up immediately as you have nothing to lose.

### Golden Tooth Monsters

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Raina Surface Camp
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 15 Jaihri
- **Rewards:** 3 Harpoons
- **Recommendations:** You'll have to go back to Riza to fight Jaihri, but... go ahead and go for it! Those Harpoons are always nice to have on hand, and Jaihri get you lots of valuable Hardwood (which at this point, you may be wanting to think about selling for Coins).

### Infected Raina Part 1

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Raina Surface Camp
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Vota, 5 Knusha, & Pay 10 Nets, and 10 Leaves
- **Rewards:** 1 Dust Water, unlock Infected Raina 2
- **Recommendations:** We mentioned that this is the region of convoluted sidequests, yes? Infected Raina 3 has some nice benefits. So for this, go ahead and fight your battles for Vota and Knusha, then go to the Forest to farm Vine Nets and Leaves as needed. (And I'd *strongly recommend* getting a jump on Infected Raina Part 2 before turning this in, for morale. That means 30 MORE Rope, 30 MORE Leaves, and 30 MORE Nets, plus all the Rope and River Grass to fight more Vota and Knusha, which means you'll probably need to farm 40 Vine Nets in Mama Tree, have 40 Leaves, then head over to the Desert and get 40 Steel and 40 Stone and craft your Nets). (And if you want to go all the way through to Part 4, that's up by 45 more for each of the above.) If you do the battles last, you might be able to pick up the next quest immediately and enjoy the benefits of overlap.

### ** Infected Raina Part 2 **

- **Unlocked by:** Infected Raina Part 1
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Pay 30 Net and 30 Leaves, and defeat 10 Vota, 10 Knusha, 10 Yala
- **Rewards:** 2 Dust Water, 1 River Chest, unlock Infected Raina 3
- **Recommendations:** Again, I'd do the battles first and then roam to the Forest and Desert to collect the rest. The resource calculators are almost required at this point.

### ** Infected Raina Part 3 **

- **Unlocked by:** Infected Raina Part 2
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Wyverns
- **Rewards:** 3 Dust Water, Wardrobe: Raina Mask https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wm&#95;featured&#95;raina&#95;mask.png , ability to craft Raina Sword and Raina Bracelet
- **Recommendations:** Almost there! You got FORTY NETS, this is a piece of cake in comparison! (Start collecting River Stones; you'll need 1000 of them to get both your shiny new beauties in the store.)

### ** 4 the Infected **

- **Unlocked by:** Infected Raina Part 3
- **Type:** Battle, Collection
- **Requirements:** Defeat 15 Knusha, 15 Vota, and 15 Yala, and pay 45 Nets and 45 Leaves
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Ardi Raina Mask https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/female/wf&#95;featured&#95;ardi&#95;raina&#95;mask&#95;yellow.png
- **Recommedations:** You're a pro by now. Decide whether you want to top it off.

### Steel Boots

(THIS IS MUCH LONGER THAN USUAL; bear with me.)

- **Unlocked by:** Opening Raina Surface Camp
- **Type:** Collection
- **Requirements:** Pay 25 Steel Boots
- **Rewards:** 1 Dust Water (what's this good for? Who knows? Nothing yet.) and 3 Stempos
- **Recommendations:** THE EVIL QUEST OF EVIL. This is OBSCENELY expensive. 
  - Each Steel Boot needs 3 Steel Bars and 1 Fabric Boot (among other items) to build. Each Fabric Boot needs 100 Coins, 3 Leafsung Boots, some Fine Fabric, Raw Fabric, and a Steel Bar to build. Each Leafsung Boot requires 2 Leaf Boots and 1 Leafsung Ink to build. Each Leafsung Ink requires 5 Essence, 5 Spider Poison, 3 Claws, and 3 Dust. 
  - So in short, if you drill down, each Steel Boot requires that you build one Fabric Boot, from Leafsung Boots, from Leaf Boots and Leafsung Ink, and Steel Bars, which means each Steel Boot needs 100 Coins, 9 Claws, 9 Dust, 15 Essence, 1 Fine Fabric, 6 Leaf Boots, 45 Leaves, 4 Raw Fabric, 2 River Grass, 15 Spider Poison, and 4 Steel Bars, which very likely will need to be made from 12 Raw Steel and 12 Wood.
  - EACH. BOOT.
  - First: make sure you've completed River Grass Supply in Riza to get the cheapest pair of Steel Boots in the game.
  - Second: make sure you've completed the Tailor quest in 3PC for the cheapest pair of Fabric Boots in the game.
  - Third: consider redoing the entire game a few times to chalk up a few more of these cheaper boots, because they're less mind-numbing than farming all the necessary materials.
    - If you decide just to take the quest right now after doing First and Second parts, you'll need 2300 Coins, 207 Claws, 207 Dust, 345 Essence, 23 Fine Fabric, 138 Leaf Boots, 1035 Leaves,  92 Raw Fabric, 48 River Grass, 345 Spider Poison (which will, at the best efficiency, require 138,000 battle-words in 345 battles against Aracni), and 95 Steel Bars, and all you get for it will be one. single. Dust Water, which has no apparent use so far and can't be sold. Consider very carefully.
    - Seriously, consider completing this quest on a later pass. It'll be less tedious spread over completing other quests.
  - Fourth: Make sure you've completed the Make &#95; Sing series of quests in Luciola Forest so you'll be able to craft Leafsung Ink in Mama Tree. (Don't waste any of your winnings on the Leafsung Vial Creation in Mama Tree at present, if you haven't yet.)
  - Fifth: You'll need bunches of Leafsung Ink for a later sidequest with a far niftier reward. Don't burn yourself out farming that now, if you haven't checked out Balance yet.
  - **Fifth and a half**: Golden Chests and River Chests just started dropping Leafsung Ink. I'm not completely rewriting this section the way I possibly should in light of this, because this means that fighting Arenica and Suulan and Desert Rudakai just became relevant to this quest, as well as * spoiler * in the Floating City of Balance. 
  - **Fifth and three quarters**: Look, just ignore the rest and come back after you've gotten far enough through Balance to find a consistent source of River Chests and River Keys, because you might just want to farm all your Leafsung Ink that way.
  - Sixth: Spider Poison will be the most demanding thing to farm, if you decide to manufacture Leafsung Ink the old-fashioned way, because you absolutely cannot get it except from a battle or a Luciola Wooden Chest. (Essence, Leaves, and Steel Bars will probably be the next-most-demanding bits). Spider Poison is best gotten from Aracni in Luciola Forest, but Illi in Mama Tree and Ylly in Gansu will give you Rope at the same time (needed for a lot of other things in the game) and some much-needed variety. Illi stack well with Tylu, which will get you Claws for the Leafsung Ink. Ylly will also help you gather Raw Fabric.
  - Seventh: So, the Steel Bars. Yasri in 3PC drop them directly, and also drop Fine Fabric that you'll need, and extra Raw Steel to help polish off. If you get tired of them, Rulo drop Raw Steel in nice quantities.
  - Eighth: Essence and Leaves can come from Desert Wignow, which conveniently also drop the Desert Stones that are in such high demand for Gansu sidequests.
  - Good luck, and may the Force be with you.
