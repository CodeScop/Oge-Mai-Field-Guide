So, you know the Shrine pretty well generally, but you want to know what the latest items are. I'll be posting that info here first, as I collect data and integrate it into the rest of the game. (Still working on quest recs right now, but you can get enough info to get an idea.)

Starting with the Birds!

#Birds



Remember, to see the following, your avatar needs to be wearing the Birds Time Bracelet, which can be purchased for 3 Shrine Tickets in the Shrine Bracelets area.

# Quests - Birds

NOTE: Once you complete a quest, it's removed from these offerings. So if you have completed a quest in a prior event, it won't be available here.

### Birb's the Word

- **Unlocked by:** Wardrobe: Birds Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each:
  - Gayol
  - Noasis
  - Peq
  - Ralbone
  - Katock
- **Rewards:** 25 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** I love the pretty birds. I think they're all awesome. Basically, if you don't like this quest, it's probably a sign this isn't the Shrine Bracelet for you.

### Peppy Piñata Party

- **Unlocked by:** Wardrobe: Birds Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 10 Katock
- **Rewards:** 50 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** Punch the piñata, 500 words at a time, and get shinies. What's not to like?

### Prime Birb Time

- **Unlocked by:** Wardrobe: Birds Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Gayol, 3 Peq, and 1 Ralbone
- **Rewards:** 25 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** The pride of defeating Ralbone should be the queen of this quest, but honestly, I think the Peq are more demanding. Still, 25 Shrine Stones is 25 Shrine Stones!

# Monsters - Birds

# Giants

Remember, to see the following, your avatar needs to be wearing the Giants Time Bracelet, which can be purchased for 10 Shrine Tickets in the Shrine Bracelets area.

# Quests - Giants

NOTE: Once you complete a quest, it's removed from these offerings. So if you have completed a quest in a prior event, it won't be available here.

### Sticks & Stones

- **Unlocked by:** Wardrobe: Giants Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Skuppa's Giant Marionette and 5 Untu Golem
- **Rewards:** 25 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** This is the second-easiest quest in this area, and you'll end up with 75 Shrine Stones including the ones you net from battles. Go for it!

### A Colossal Quest

- **Unlocked by:** Wardrobe: Giants Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each:
  - Skuppa's Giant Marionette
  - Giant Dust Spirit
  - Untu Golem
  - Piachi
  - Guardian
  - Takra
  - Caravan
  - Mandias
- **Rewards:** 75 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** Pace yourself. The Untu Golem will be the most challenging if you write onsite - 12 minutes is not much time to write 500 words. The Caravan will be the most endurance-demanding for lower-output writers, although if you have a sufficiently high Defense (like, anything over 16) you'll have 4 days to write 5K words, and if you can scrape >+44 Defense it'll be 5 days.

### Prime Party Piñata

- **Unlocked by:** Wardrobe: Giants Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Takra
- **Rewards:** 25 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:** Easiest quest in this bunch, hands-down. Plus, piñata.

### The Shrine-Stone Trail

- **Unlocked by:** Wardrobe: Giants Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Caravans
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Tambo Mane https://media.4thewords.com/s3/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;644-tambo-mane-3765-86009.png
- **Recommendations:** This monster is intimdating for low-output writers, but it's honestly not that bad. If you have >+21 Attack and >+15 Defense, it's less than 1K/day in actuality. If that's still too gruelling, write offsite and paste in. And if you're a high-output writer, glory in the great loot of the Caravan.
