# Quests - NPC

###NPC's Here to Help

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Wardrobe: Special Event NPC Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 1 each: 
  - Untu Captain Uo
  - Captain Shin
  - First Officer Yu
  - Uurwall Uzgot
  - Vinstacio
  - Skuppa
  - Witch Monvoisin
- **Rewards:** Wardrobe: Uurwall's Carnival Pants https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;1577-uurwall-joker-pants-11156-37903.png
- **Recommendations:**  Look, you didn't buy that Bracelet to NOT fight all the monsters here and add them to your Bestiary. You know you didn't. Go ahead and get them! And get a new pair of pants while you're at it!

###Untu Leaders United

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Wardrobe: Special Event NPC Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 each: 
  - Captain Shin
  - Untu Captain Uo
- **Rewards:** 25 Shrine Stones, Wardrobe x2: Captain Shin Hair https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;shin&#95;hair&#95;blue.png and Shin Earrings https://4thewords.com/media/wardrobe/featured/male/wm&#95;featured&#95;shin&#95;earrings.png
- **Recommendations:**  This hair was the first thing I desperately wanted to spend Crystals on when I joined, and these were my first earrings, so I'm quite nostalgic for them. I also have no need for them, and that desperate feeling predates about 95% of the wardrobe options we now have. So it's hard to evaluate whether they're worth 12K battle words - you'll have to decide for yourself.

###Aid of Assistants

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Wardrobe: Special Event NPC Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 3 each: 
  - First Officer Yu
  - Vinstacio
  - Skuppa
- **Rewards:** 50 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:**  Hey, look, the only quest here combining different monsters featured at the same event! (Look, Shrine quests tend to be pretty self-evident in terms of recommendations, I enjoy adding trivia like this.)

###Which Witch Is This?

- **Location:** Shrine of Ages
- **Unlocked by:** Wardrobe: Special Event NPC Time Bracelet
- **Type:** Battle
- **Requirements:** Defeat 5 Witch Monvoisin
- **Rewards:** 75 Shrine Stones
- **Recommendations:**  This is a pretty darn good Shrine Stone grinder, if you're after that.
